# T28 Pre-Brainstorm Analysis Plan

**Created:** 2026-04-07 | **Status:** IN PROGRESS | **Branch:** planning-4626

Goal: Analyze repos covering all content extraction source types before
brainstorming the Unified Content Intelligence System (T28). Build comprehensive
extraction journal data so the brainstorm has prior art for every source type.

---

## Process

1. **Quick Scan all repos in cluster** — triage for Standard worthiness
2. **Standard the valuable ones** — full Creator + Engineer views
3. **After each cluster** — spin up background gap agent that reads the
   cluster's analyses and asks: "Given what these repos taught us about this
   extraction layer, what process gaps, architectural questions, or design
   unknowns remain for T28?" The agent looks inward at what we've learned, not
   outward for more repos.
4. **Back-end pass** — review gap agent findings, address open questions
5. **Final gap sweep** — re-scan across all 28 source types for architectural
   blind spots

---

## Gap Agent Specification

Each gap agent receives:

- The cluster's completed analyses (creator-view.md, value-map.json)
- The T28 goal (unified extraction → analysis → synthesis layers)
- What we've already analyzed (prior clusters + T27 repos)

It produces a short report answering:

- What extraction patterns are still unclear for this source type?
- What architectural decisions aren't covered by any analyzed repo?
- How does this cluster's approach connect to or conflict with prior clusters?
- What would break if we tried to normalize this source type into the shared
  analysis layer?
- What's the hardest unsolved problem for T28 in this domain?

Output: `.research/repo-analysis/_gap-agent-{cluster}.md`
