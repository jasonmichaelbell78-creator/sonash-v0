## Hook Improvement Example

**User's Original Hook**:

> "Product management is changing because of AI. In this article, I'll discuss
> some ways AI affects product managers."

**Option 1 (Data-driven)**:

> "Last month, I asked AI to analyze 500 customer interviews. It took 30 minutes
> instead of 3 weeks. Product management will never be the same."

**Option 2 (Question)**:

> "What if you could talk to every customer, read every review, and analyze
> every support ticket--all before your morning coffee?"

**Option 3 (Story)**:

> "Sarah spent two weeks building the wrong feature. Not because she didn't
> understand her users, but because she couldn't process the hundreds of
> interviews fast enough to spot the pattern."
