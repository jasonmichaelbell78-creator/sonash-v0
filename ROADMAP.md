#### Critical Security Fixes (✅ Complete - Dec 20, 2025)

- ✅ Close Firestore rules bypass for `daily_logs` (remove direct client write)
- ✅ Fix rate limiter fail-open vulnerability (change to fail-closed)
- ✅ Protect admin reset functionality (dev-only mode)
- ✅ Refactor SSR unsafe exports in `lib/firebase.ts` (proxy guards)

#### High-Priority Bug Fixes (✅ Complete - Dec 20, 2025)

*Note: Most fixes were already implemented in prior sessions, verified during Dec 20 analysis*

- ✅ Date handling standardization (`getTodayDateId()` in `date-utils.ts`)

**Analysis Report:** See [docs/archive/2025-dec-reports/CONSOLIDATED_CODE_ANALYSIS.md](./docs/archive/2025-dec-reports/CONSOLIDATED_CODE_ANALYSIS.md)

**Testing Guide:** See [TESTING_CHECKLIST.md](./TESTING_CHECKLIST.md), [docs/TESTING_PLAN.md](./docs/TESTING_PLAN.md)

### Week 13+: Multi-AI Security Review Remediation (🔄 In Progress - Dec 21, 2025)

*Based on December 21, 2025 multi-AI code review (5 models: CODEX, GEMINI, JULES, CLAUDE, CLAUDE CODE)*

**Analysis Results:**
- **Total Issues Identified:** 95 → **71 TRUE OPEN** (after verification)
- **Sources:** 5 new AI models + baseline 6-model aggregation
- **Report:** See artifacts - `AUTHORITATIVE_ISSUE_REPORT.md`

#### Critical Security Fixes (Week 13 - Immediate)

- ✅ **Journal Collection Security Gap** (JULES #3) - ✅ **FIXED (Verified Dec 21, 2025)**
  - **Issue:** `journal` collection allows direct client writes while `daily_logs` properly blocks them
  - **Impact:** Bypasses rate limiting and App Check completely
  - **Fix:** Block direct writes in `firestore.rules:35-40`, create `saveJournalEntry` Cloud Function
  - **Status:** Verified complete - identical security to daily_logs
  - **Priority:** ~~IMMEDIATE~~ COMPLETE

- ✅ **Account Linking Data Loss** (CODEX #5) - ✅ **FIXED Dec 21, 2025**
  - **Issue:** When credential-already-in-use, signs into existing account WITHOUT migrating anonymous data
  - **Impact:** Users lose anonymous journal data
  - **Fix:** ✅ Implemented data migration Cloud Function with smart conflict resolution
  - **Status:** Deployed to production (sonash-app)
  - **Future Enhancement:** Full conflict resolution UI (see M1.5 Planned)

#### High-Priority Fixes (Week 13-14)

- ✅ **Test Assertions Don't Match Implementation** (CLAUDE CODE #1) - ⏳ **DEFERRED**
  - Tests mock direct Firestore but implementation uses Cloud Functions
  - Impact: False confidence - tests pass but don't reflect actual behavior
  - Fix: Rewrite tests to mock `httpsCallable`
  - Status: Deferred - not blocking production, can address in future sprint

- ✅ **Feature Flag System Non-Functional** (CLAUDE CODE #3) - ✅ **FIXED Dec 21, 2025**
  - Issue: `featureFlagEnabled()` always returns true (was hardcoded)
  - Impact: Cannot gate features, staged rollouts impossible
  - Fix: ✅ Implemented proper environment variable reading with Next.js integration
  - Status: Working - supports `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` flags for staged rollouts

- ✅ **Timeline Array Mutation** - ✅ **FIXED Dec 21, 2025**
  - One-line fix (`[...entries].sort()`)
  - Status: Deployed

- ✅ **Error Handling Missing** - ✅ **FIXED Dec 21, 2025**
  - Added try/finally to links-tab, prayers-tab
  - Status: Deployed

- ❌ **Daily Log History Ordering** - ✅ **VERIFIED CORRECT Dec 21, 2025**
  - Reviewed alignment of dateId vs date field
  - Status: Already working correctly, no action needed

- ❌ **Account Linking Production Errors** - 🐛 **DISCOVERED Dec 21, 2025**
  - Google OAuth fails with COOP (Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy) errors
  - Email/password linking fails with 400 Bad Request
  - Impact: Users cannot link accounts, migration function untested
  - Fix: Update Firebase Hosting headers in `firebase.json`
  - Priority: HIGH - blocks account linking feature

- ❌ **Missing Rate Limiting** - saveInventoryEntry, getHistory, getInventoryEntries
- ❌ **Onboarding Overwrites Profiles** - Check existing profile before recreate
- ❌ **Composite Indexes Missing** - Library queries need indexes

#### Medium Priority (Week 15-16)

- Firestore rules overly permissive for user profiles
- Delete operations without GDPR audit logging
- Date validation missing in Cloud Function
- localStorage unencrypted for journal data
- Inefficient meeting sorting (parseTime regex)
- Nested context providers cause re-renders
- Monolithic components remain (ResourcesPage, AllMeetingsPage)
- TypeScript strict flags missing (noUncheckedIndexedAccess)
- useAuth deprecated but still used
- *[32 total medium priority issues - see report for complete list]*

#### Low Priority (Week 17+)

- Debug console.log statements in production code
- Console logs expose configuration
- README lacks setup instructions
- *[24 total low priority issues - see report for complete list]*

## 🖥️ M1.6 - Admin Panel Enhancement (🔄 In Progress)

**Goal:** Operational monitoring and system visibility for admins

**Detailed Specification:** See [SoNash__AdminPanelEnhancement__v1_2__2025-12-22.md](./SoNash__AdminPanelEnhancement__v1_2__2025-12-22.md)

**Phase 1 Prompt:** See [SoNash__Phase1_ClaudeCode_Prompt__v1_3__2025-12-22.md](./SoNash__Phase1_ClaudeCode_Prompt__v1_3__2025-12-22.md)

### Current Admin Infrastructure

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Admin route (`/app/admin/`) | ✅ Exists |
| Tab navigation (8 tabs) | ✅ Exists |
| `AdminCrudTable<T>` component | ✅ Exists |
| Cloud Functions auth (`requireAdmin()`) | ✅ Exists |
| Firestore rules (`isAdmin()`) | ✅ Exists |
| Sentry integration | ✅ Exists |
| `logSecurityEvent()` → GCP Cloud Logging | ✅ Exists |
| Server-side admin route protection | ⚠️ Missing (Phase 1) |

### Security Requirements (v1.2)

All admin Cloud Functions MUST:
- Call `requireAdmin(request)` as first operation
- Enforce App Check (`enforceAppCheck: true`)
- Return only non-sensitive aggregated data
- Hash/redact user identifiers in responses
- Log admin actions via `logSecurityEvent()` to GCP Cloud Logging (immutable)
- **Keep API tokens server-side only** (never expose to client)

### Phase 1: Dashboard + Foundations (🔄 In Progress)

**Priority:** High | **Effort:** Medium | **Value:** High

- [ ] Server-side middleware with session verification + admin claim check
- [ ] System health at a glance (Firestore, Auth, Functions status)
- [ ] Active user metrics (24h, 7d, 30d)
- [ ] Recent signups list
- [ ] Background jobs status overview
- [ ] Throttled `lastActive` timestamp tracking (15 min via localStorage)
- [ ] Firestore rules for `/_health` and `/admin_jobs`

**New Files:**
- `middleware.ts` - Server-side admin route protection
- `lib/firebase-admin.ts` - Firebase Admin SDK initialization
- `app/api/auth/verify-admin/route.ts` - Session verification API
- `app/unauthorized/page.tsx` - Unauthorized access page
- `components/admin/dashboard-tab.tsx` - Dashboard UI

**Cloud Functions:**
- `adminHealthCheck` - Tests Firestore/Auth connectivity
- `adminGetDashboardStats` - Returns user counts, signups, job statuses

### Phase 2: Enhanced User Lookup (📋 Planned)

**Priority:** High | **Effort:** Medium | **Value:** High

- [ ] Search users by email, UID, or nickname
- [ ] User detail drawer with full profile
- [ ] Activity timeline (daily logs, journal entries)
- [ ] Account actions (disable, export data)
- [ ] Admin notes field
- [ ] All admin actions logged to GCP Cloud Logging

### Phase 3: Background Jobs Monitoring (📋 Planned)

**Priority:** Medium | **Effort:** Low | **Value:** Medium

- [ ] Jobs registry in Firestore (`admin_jobs` collection)
- [ ] Job wrapper for status tracking (with `logSecurityEvent()`)
- [ ] Jobs tab UI
- [ ] Manual trigger capability
- [ ] Schedule `cleanupOldRateLimits` in Cloud Scheduler

### Phase 4: Error Tracking - Sentry Integration (📋 Planned)

**Priority:** High | **Effort:** Low-Medium | **Value:** High

**Approach:** Hybrid summary + deep links via Cloud Function (token never exposed to client)

- [ ] `adminGetSentryErrorSummary` Cloud Function (server-side API call)
- [ ] Error summary card on Dashboard (count + trend)
- [ ] Errors tab with recent errors in plain English
- [ ] Deep links to Sentry for each error
- [ ] User ID correlation (link to user detail if available)

**Environment Variables (Cloud Functions only):** `SENTRY_API_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`

### Phase 5: System Logs - GCP Integration (📋 Planned)

**Priority:** Medium | **Effort:** Low | **Value:** Medium

**Approach:** Recent events + deep links (don't rebuild GCP logging UI)

- [ ] Recent security events display (from existing `logSecurityEvent()`)
- [ ] Deep link to GCP Cloud Logging Console (pre-filtered)
- [ ] Verify log retention configured (90+ days)
- [ ] Optional: Log sink for long-term archival

**Note:** Security/audit logs remain in GCP Cloud Logging (immutable, compliant) — no Firestore `admin_logs` collection.

### New Firestore Collections

```
/admin_jobs/{jobId}       - Background job registry
/_health/ping             - Health check document
```

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Time to identify issue | < 2 minutes |
| Dashboard load time | < 3 seconds |
| Error visibility | 100% of Cloud Function errors |
| Job failure detection | < 1 hour after failure |
