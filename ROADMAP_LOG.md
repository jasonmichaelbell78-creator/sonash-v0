**Completed Items:**
- ✅ **Manual reCAPTCHA Enterprise Integration:**
  - Frontend: `lib/recaptcha.ts` - `getRecaptchaToken()` helper for all protected operations
  - Backend: `functions/src/recaptcha-verify.ts` - Server-side token validation with Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise API
  - Security wrapper: Integrated into all 5 Cloud Functions (`saveDailyLog`, `saveJournalEntry`, `softDeleteJournalEntry`, `saveInventoryEntry`, `migrateAnonymousUserData`)
  - Made optional: Corporate networks block Google reCAPTCHA → logs `RECAPTCHA_MISSING_TOKEN` (WARNING) instead of blocking
  - Event logging: Added 8 reCAPTCHA event types to `security-logger.ts`
  - Commits: `b6fe5e9`, `9e83e86`, `a818bea`, `b402f41`, `16b5deb`
- ✅ **8-Phase Refactoring Plan Documentation:**

    - ⚠️ CANON-0041: Rate limiting alignment (60% complete - primary ops aligned)
    - ❌ CANON-0002: App Check enforcement (0% - DISABLED everywhere)
    - ❓ CANON-0043: Client validation strategy (unknown - needs decision)
  - Commit: `50e5c3e`, `f391927`
- ✅ **Admin Panel Security Monitoring Requirements:**
  - Created `docs/ADMIN_PANEL_SECURITY_MONITORING_REQUIREMENTS.md` - Detailed spec for monitoring missing reCAPTCHA tokens
  - Commit: `3b651fa`
- ✅ **CodeRabbit Technical Debt Items:**
  - Added to `ROADMAP.md` M2 section (duplicate reCAPTCHA logic, migrateAnonymousUserData manual security checks, FirestoreService god object)
  - Commit: `ce9cdb3`

**Status Changes:**
- ❌ **Firebase App Check:** DISABLED in all Cloud Functions (`requireAppCheck: false`)
  - Reason: Hit 403 throttle errors (24-hour limit)
