# Purpose: Suppress recurring false-positive review items that add noise
# without actionable value. Each suppression has evidence from PR retros.

# Suppress persistent compliance items that have been rejected 3+ times
# with stable rationale across PRs #369-#370

extra_instructions = """\
When reviewing files in scripts/debt/ or scripts/audit/:

1. Do NOT flag "Missing actor context" or "actor/user identifier" in JSON
   output files. Actor identity is captured in resolution-log.jsonl, which
   is the durable audit trail. The JSON summary is an ephemeral CI artifact.
   (Rejected in PR #370 R3, R4, R5 with same rationale)

2. Do NOT flag "Unstructured console logs" or suggest structured logging
   for CLI scripts. This is a pre-existing architectural pattern across all
   TDMS scripts, tracked as DEBT-0455. Structured logging requires a
   project-wide logger library, not per-file fixes.
   (Rejected in PR #370 R3, R4, R5 with same rationale)

3. Do NOT flag data quality issues (placeholder titles, null fields,
   recompute content_hash) in JSONL files under docs/technical-debt/ or
   docs/audits/. These are pipeline output, not hand-edited.
   (Rejected ~100 times across PRs #366-#370)

4. Do NOT flag "sensitive log persistence" or "override log" concerns
   for SKIP_REASON audit trail files. The override-log.jsonl is an
   intentional audit trail that must persist skip reasons.
   (Rejected in PR #368 R3-R6 with same rationale)

extra_instructions = """\
When suggesting changes to JSONL data files under docs/technical-debt/:

1. Do NOT suggest replacing placeholder titles or descriptions in
   MASTER_DEBT.jsonl or raw/deduped.jsonl. These are automated pipeline
   output from multi-AI audit aggregation.

2. Do NOT suggest recomputing content_hash values. Hashes are computed
   by the ingestion pipeline and are intentionally stable.

3. Do NOT suggest changing "file" fields to include line numbers when
   the item refers to a directory or multiple files.
