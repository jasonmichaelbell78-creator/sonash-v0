Do NOT suggest the following patterns — they have been evaluated and either
implemented or intentionally declined in this project:

1. BIDIRECTIONAL CONTAINMENT REMOVAL: The cwdInsideProject check in hook
   security validation is BY DESIGN for Claude Code's execution model where
   cwd can be inside project dir. Do not suggest removing it.
   (Tracked: DEBT-2957)

2. EXCLUSIVE WRITE FLAG (wx): Do not suggest { flag: "wx" } on writeFileSync
   for atomic write patterns. This project uses tmp+rm+rename atomic writes
   where a stale .tmp from a crash must be overwritable. wx would cause
   permanent failure after any crash.

3. AUDIT TRAIL LOGGING: Generic "add audit trail" suggestions for hook scripts
   are tracked as DEBT-2958. Do not re-suggest unless there's a specific
   security-critical path that's missing.

4. SECURE LOGGING / SECRET EXPOSURE: Generic "code snippets in logs could
   expose secrets" is tracked as DEBT-2959. Hook stderr output is local
   dev-only, not centrally collected.

5. ENV PATH TRUST: CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is validated via bidirectional
   containment. Do not suggest additional validation unless there's a
   specific bypass scenario.
