| **Sober Living Finder** | 🟢 MEDIUM | Listed as "future" in 7.1 | Good; already planned |
| **Court/Legal Tracking** | 🔵 LOW | For compliance documentation | Consider for "Work" tab |
| **Medication Reminders** | 🔵 LOW | MAT (medication-assisted treatment) users | Future consideration |
| **Peer Matching** | 🔵 LOW | Privacy/moderation concerns | Defer (not in roadmap) |

### 🔄 Technical Recommendations NOT in Roadmap

| Recommendation | Current Roadmap | Gap Analysis |
|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Offline-First Architecture** | "Optional later" (10.5) | Should be Phase 3 requirement |
| **Service Worker Caching** | Mentioned as PWA | Not explicitly planned |
| **CSP Headers** | Not mentioned | Add to Quality Schedule (Q2) |

| **Sentry/LogRocket Integration** | Not mentioned | Add to Phase 5 launch prep |
| **Performance Budget** | Lighthouse 90+ (Q2) | Good but needs bundle size limits |
| **Automated E2E Testing** | "Basic E2E flows" (Q2) | Should include Playwright/Cypress setup |
| **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance** | "Screen reader-friendly" (19) | Not specific enough; add audit |
| **Data Encryption at Rest** | Not mentioned | Add to Security Audit (Q2) |

---

## 2. Contradictions & Conflicts

### ❌ No Major Contradictions Found

The recommendations **complement** rather than conflict with the roadmap. However, there are **priority disagreements**:

| Recommendation | Roadmap | Conflict Type | Resolution |
|----------------|---------|---------------|------------|
| **App Lock** | "Optional app lock (later)" | **PRIORITY** | Move to Phase 6 instead of "later" |
| **Offline Support** | "Optional later" | **PRIORITY** | Make required in Phase 3 |
| **Crisis Features** | Not in any phase | **OMISSION** | Add Crisis Support to Phase 3-4 |
| **Anonymous Mode** | Not mentioned | **OMISSION** | Add to Phase 6 privacy settings |

---

## 3. Roadmap Phasing Analysis

### Current Roadmap Phases (Existing)

- **Phase 1**: Cover & Shell ✅ Done
- **Phase 2**: Auth & User Profile 🔄 In Progress
- **Phase 3**: Today Page (check-in, tracker, reading) 📋 Next
- **Phase 4**: Resources (meetings, help links) 📋 Planned
- **Phase 5**: Support Circle 📋 Planned
- **Phase 6**: Settings Overlay 📋 Planned
- **Phase 7**: Journal Vault 📋 Planned
- **Phases 8+**: Steps, Spiritual, Learning, Challenges, Admin

### Recommended Phase Adjustments

#### 🔴 Phase 3 - Add Crisis Support

**Current**: Today page with check-in, tracker, reading
**Recommended Addition**:
- Crisis SOS button (always visible)
- "Need help right now?" card
- Quick access to crisis contacts

**Rationale**: Users in early recovery (target audience) face frequent crises. This should be available from day 1 of app usage, not deferred.

#### 🔴 Phase 3 - Make Offline-First Required

**Current**: "Optional later"
**Recommended**: Core architectural requirement
**Rationale**: Target users have unstable housing, inconsistent data plans. App must work offline or it won't work for them.

#### 🟡 Phase 4 - Add Crisis Text Line

**Current**: Help & Outreach Links (voice calls only)
**Recommended**: Text-based crisis support
**Rationale**: Many users can't safely make calls (shared spaces, domestic situations).

#### 🟡 Phase 6 - Prioritize App Lock

**Current**: "Optional app lock (later)"
**Recommended**: PIN/biometric lock in Phase 6
**Rationale**: Journal contains deeply personal step work. App lock should launch with journal vault.

#### 🟢 Phase 7+ - Add Relapse Recovery Mode

**Current**: Not mentioned
**Recommended**: Add to slip/tough day logging (6.2)
**Rationale**: Recovery is non-linear. App should gracefully handle relapse without shame.

## 4. Business & Growth Strategies

### Not in Technical Roadmap (Expected)

The existing ROADMAP.md is **product/technical focused**. My recommendations included business strategies that are appropriately **not** in a technical roadmap:

- Partnership strategies (clinics, recovery houses, courts)
- Revenue models (freemium, B2B, grants)
- Marketing/growth tactics (SEO, community outreach, peer referrals)
- Legal compliance beyond security (HIPAA, 42 CFR Part 2, ADA)

**Recommendation**: Create separate `BUSINESS_ROADMAP.md` or `GO_TO_MARKET.md` for non-technical planning.

---

## 5. Quality & Testing Comparison

### Existing Quality Schedule (ROADMAP.md Section 1)

**Q1 - End of Phase 3:**
- Static analysis (strict TypeScript, linting)
- Unit tests (FirestoreService, AuthProvider)
- Manual QA (Airplane Mode test)

**Q2 - End of Phase 5:**
- Security: Firestore rules audit, localStorage check
- Performance: Lighthouse 90+, image optimization
- Automated testing: Basic E2E flows

### Recommended Enhancements

| Gap | Add to Which Phase | Details |
|-----|-------------------|---------|
| **Component Testing** | Q1 | Add React Testing Library tests for all modules |
| **Security Testing** | Q2 | Add OWASP ZAP scan, dependency audits (npm audit) |
| **Accessibility Testing** | Q2 | Add axe-core, manual screen reader testing |
| **Performance Budget** | Q2 | Set hard limits: JS bundle < 200KB, FCP < 1.8s |
| **Error Monitoring** | Before Phase 5 Launch | Sentry for production error tracking |
| **Analytics Setup** | Before Phase 5 Launch | Privacy-respecting analytics (Plausible/Fathom) |

## 13. Comparison Summary by Category

### ✅ Strong Alignment (Keep As-Is)

- Core feature set (check-in, tracker, journal, support circle)
- Notebook UI metaphor and navigation
- Firebase backend architecture
- Privacy-first design (user-scoped Firestore rules)
- Recovery-specific features (steps, prayers, challenges)
- Admin content management system
- Accessibility commitment (large text, simple language)

### 🔄 Good Foundation, Needs Enhancement

- **Offline support** - Mentioned but not prioritized high enough
- **App lock** - Planned for "later" but should be Phase 6

- **Security** - Strong rules but missing CSP, encryption, HIPAA

### 🆕 Critical Gaps to Address

1. **Crisis support features** - Not in roadmap at all
2. **Anonymous mode** - Privacy concern not addressed
3. **Relapse recovery flow** - Assumes linear progress
4. **Offline-first architecture** - Not mandatory
5. **HIPAA compliance** - Required for partnerships
6. **Business/growth strategy** - Separate from tech roadmap (expected)

### ❌ No Contradictions

Recommendations **enhance** rather than conflict with existing roadmap.

   - ADA/WCAG 2.1 AA
   - Terms of Service / Privacy Policy
4. 📝 **Create `BUSINESS_ROADMAP.md`** (optional):
   - Separate business/growth strategies from technical roadmap

---

## 15. Conclusion

### Overall Assessment: Strong Foundation, Key Gaps

The existing ROADMAP.md demonstrates:
- ✅ **Deep user empathy** for people in early recovery
- ✅ **Thoughtful feature design** covering core recovery needs
- ✅ **Clear phased approach** to implementation
- ✅ **Privacy-first architecture** with user-scoped data

However, it is **missing critical safety features** that could be the difference between relapse and recovery:
- 🔴 Crisis support (SOS button, text-based help)
- 🔴 Offline-first architecture (for users with unstable access)
- 🔴 Relapse recovery mode (non-shaming reset flow)
- 🟡 App lock prioritization (protect deeply personal content)
- 🟡 HIPAA compliance (required for clinic/court partnerships)

**Recommendation**: Integrate crisis support and offline-first features into Phase 3 as **non-negotiable requirements**. These are not "nice to have" features for the target population—they are essential for the app to fulfill its mission of supporting people in early recovery.
