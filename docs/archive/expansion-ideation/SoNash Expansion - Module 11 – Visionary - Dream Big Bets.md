# SoNash Expansion: Module 11 – Visionary / "Dream Big" Bets

## Purpose

Expansion module ideation document exploring visionary and advanced technology
features for the SoNash app, using Bluetooth, AI, and geofencing to facilitate
human connection and recovery community building.

## Version History

| Version | Date       | Description           |

| 1.0     | 2026-01-27 | Initial documentation |

**Core Philosophy:** "Technology Serving Spirit." We use advanced tech
(Bluetooth, AI, Geofencing) not to replace human connection, but to _facilitate_
it. These features make the "invisible" network of recovery visible and turn the
user's isolated data into a powerful life narrative.

## Part 1: Expansions of Existing Ideas

### 1. "SoNash Beacon" (The Silent Handshake)

- **The Concept:** Walking into a massive concert, festival, or airport can feel
  isolating for a sober person. They assume everyone is drinking. They need to
  know they aren't alone _right now_.
- **The Tool:** Anonymous Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radar.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **The Tech:** Uses the same tech as COVID exposure notifications (no GPS,
    just proximity).
  - **The Experience:** The user checks the "Beacon" tab. It glows and says:
    _"There are 14 other SoNash users within 100 feet."_
  - **The Privacy:** No names, no photos, no map location. Just a number. It
    validates the user's reality: "I am not the only sober person here."
  - **The Opt-In:** Strictly voluntary "Beacon Mode" toggle (e.g., only turn it
    on at Bonnaroo or a Titans game).

### 2. "Reclaiming the City" (Living Amends Map)

- **The Concept:** For an addict, a city is a minefield of trauma: _"That's
  where I was arrested," "That's where I bought drugs."_ We need to physically
  overwrite these memories.
- **The Tool:** A dynamic territory-capture game.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **The Pins:** Users drop private pins on "Trigger Locations" (Red).
  - **The Action:** When they visit that spot and do something positive (e.g.,
    have coffee with a sponsor, help a friend move), they "Claim" the spot.
  - **The Visual:** The pin turns from Red to Green. Over time, the map of
    Nashville transforms from a "Map of Shame" to a "Map of Redemption."

### 3. "The Digital Coffee Table" (Sponsor Workspace)

- **The Concept:** Currently, sponsorship happens via disjointed texts and PDFs.
  We need a shared digital desk where two people can look at the same document
  simultaneously.
- **The Tool:** A secure, real-time shared folder.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **Live Sync:** When the sponsee types in a Step 4 inventory, the sponsor
    sees it update in real-time (like Google Docs), allowing for immediate
    feedback during a call.
  - **"The Lockbox":** A specific folder where the sponsee drops "completed"
    work. The sponsor cannot browse the rest of the app/journal, only what is in
    the Lockbox.
  - **The Divorce Protocol:** If the relationship ends, one tap breaks the link.
    The sponsor loses all access immediately, and the data stays with the
    sponsee.

### 4. "The Warm Handoff" (Nashville Recovery Hub)

- **The Concept:** The most dangerous moment is the 2 hours after leaving a
  treatment center. The "Discharge Packet" is usually a crumpled piece of paper.
- **The Tool:** B2B integration for Treatment Centers.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **The Onboarding:** The treatment center sets up the user's profile _before_
    discharge.
  - **The Data:** Pre-loaded with: _Their Aftercare Plan, First 3 Appointments,
    Housing Gate Code, Temporary Sponsor's Phone Number._
  - **The Handoff:** The user walks out the door with the app already guiding
    them to their next safe location.

### 5. "The Mirror" (AI Sponsor Companion)

- **The Concept:** Users spiral at 3 AM when their sponsor is asleep. They need
  a "Socratic Mirror" to help them think, not a bot to give advice.
- **The Tool:** Local-LLM (On-Device AI) trained on 12-Step Literature.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **The Guardrails:** The AI is hard-coded to _never_ give advice. It only
    asks questions.
    - _User:_ "I want to drink."
    - _Bot:_ "What is happening right now that makes you want to escape?" (Not:
      "Don't do it!")
  - **The Memory:** It remembers the user's "Why" and reminds them: _"You said
    you were doing this for your daughter. How would drinking affect that?"_
  - **Privacy:** Runs 100% on-device. No cloud data logging.

### 6. "The Scroll of Life" (Visual Timeline)

- **The Concept:** "Days Sober" is a boring metric. A life is made of moments,
  not numbers. We want to visualize the _reconstruction_ of a life.
- **The Tool:** A rich-media chronological stream.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **Data Fusion:** Combines _Milestones + Journal Entries + Uploaded Photos +
    Meeting Attendance._
  - **The View:** A beautiful, scrollable timeline. _"On Day 30, you picked up
    your chip (Photo) and wrote about Hope (Text)."_
  - **The Book:** One-click order to print a physical hardbound book of the
    first year (great for anniversaries).

## Part 2: New Ideas (Visionary Bets)

### 7. "The Family Bridge" (Trust Dashboard)

- **The Concept:** Families are traumatized and don't trust the addict. The
  addict feels micromanaged. We need a "Trust but Verify" window that protects
  dignity.
- **The Tool:** A limited "Read-Only" guest view for a spouse/parent.
- **Feature:**
  - **What they SEE:** "Verified Actions" only. _Did they go to a meeting? Did
    they pass a drug test (if logged)? Are they at the Sober Living house
    (Geofence Check-in)?_
  - **What they DO NOT SEE:** Journal entries, Inventory, Chat logs.
  - **Why:** It automates "Proof of Life" so the spouse doesn't have to ask "Did
    you go?" 10 times a day.

### 8. "The 90-in-90 Passport" (Gamified Local Exploration)

- **The Concept:** Newcomers are told to do "90 meetings in 90 days." It's a
  grind. Let's make it an exploration of the city.
- **The Tool:** A digital "Stamp Book."
- **Feature:**
  - **The Challenge:** Visit 90 _unique_ meetings in Nashville.
  - **The Verification:** GPS check-in or scanning a QR code at participating
    clubhouses.
  - **The Reward:** Unlocking local "perks" (e.g., a free coffee at a
    sober-friendly cafe) or just a rare digital badge.
  - **Why:** It pushes the user out of their comfort zone and forces them to
    meet new people across the entire city.

### 9. "The Service Exchange" (Gig Economy for Good)

- **The Concept:** Recovering addicts often have skills (mechanics, carpentry,
  coding) but no money. They need to help each other.
- **The Tool:** A barter-system bulletin board.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Post:** _"I am a mechanic. I will fix brakes in exchange for help
    moving furniture."_
  - **The Currency:** "Service Hours" (no money changes hands).
  - **The Safety:** Verified users only (Sober Living residents).
  - **Why:** It builds economic resilience and interdependence within the local
    recovery community.

### 10. "Voice from the Past" (Audio Time Capsule)

- **The Concept:** The brain forgets the pain of addiction ("Euphoric Recall").
  We need a message from the "Desperate Self" to the "Complacent Self."
- **The Tool:** A locked audio vault.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Recording:** On Day 1 (or during a crisis), the user records a
    video/audio: _"I am shaking. I lost my job. Please don't go back to this."_
  - **The Lock:** It is sealed.
  - **The Trigger:** If the user logs a "High Craving" or marks "Complacent"
    mood, the app asks: _"Do you want to listen to yourself from Day 1?"_
  - **Why:** It breaks the romanticization of the relapse.
