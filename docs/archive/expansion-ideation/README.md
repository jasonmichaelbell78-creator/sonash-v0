# SoNash Expansion Ideation Archive

**Status**: Archived (2026-01-28)

This folder contains the original multi-AI ideation documents for SoNash feature
expansion. These documents were used during the expansion evaluation process
(Session #87-91).

## Contents

- 14 module ideation documents (Modules 1-14)
- Technical modules document
- Full consolidated ideation document

## Usage

These documents are for reference only. The evaluated ideas have been
incorporated into:

- [ROADMAP.md](../../../ROADMAP.md) - Active sprint items
- [ROADMAP_FUTURE.md](../../../ROADMAP_FUTURE.md) - Future milestones
- [EXPANSION_EVALUATION_TRACKER.md](../../EXPANSION_EVALUATION_TRACKER.md) -
  Evaluation decisions

## Why Archived

Per Session #113 process audit quick wins - these reference docs clutter the
active docs folder.
