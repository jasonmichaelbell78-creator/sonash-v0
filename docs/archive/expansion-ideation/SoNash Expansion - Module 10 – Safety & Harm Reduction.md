dead. This module strips away judgment and focuses entirely on preserving life,
protecting legal rights, and minimizing the damage of a recurrence.

---

## Part 1: Expansions of Existing Ideas

### 1. "The Lifeline" (Panic Button)

- **The Concept:** In a crisis (overdose, suicide ideation, terrifying craving),
  fine motor skills and cognitive function drop. Finding a contact in a phone
  list is impossible.
- **The Tool:** A single-tap emergency overrides system.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **The UI:** A floating red button available on the home screen (optional
    toggle).
  - **The Action:** One tap opens a large-text menu:
    - **"Call 911"** (Auto-dials).
    - **"Text Sponsor"** (Sends pre-written: _"I am in trouble. Please call
      me."_).
    - **"Crisis Line"** (Connects to National Suicide/Crisis Lifeline).
  - **The "Silent" Mode:** If in a dangerous domestic situation, a specific
    gesture can send a GPS location to a trusted contact without making a sound.

### 2. "The Guardrails" (Trigger Warnings)

- **The Concept:** Deep step work (Step 4 trauma, Step 9 amends) can
  re-traumatize a user or put them in physical danger (e.g., making amends to an
  abuser).
- **The Tool:** Context-aware friction.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **Trauma Gate:** Before opening a "Sex Conduct" or "Harms" inventory, a
    modal asks: _"Are you in a safe headspace to do this work right now?"_
  - **Amends Gate:** If a user logs an amends to someone flagged as "Ex" or
    "Family," the app prompts: _"Have you discussed the safety of this contact
    with your sponsor?"_
  - **The "Eject" Handle:** A persistent "I need a break" button on these pages
    that instantly switches the screen to a breathing exercise or cute animal
    photos (palate cleanser).

### 3. "The Harm Reduction Locker" (OD Prevention)

- **The Concept:** Users may relapse. If they do, they need info on how to
  survive it, not a lecture.
- **The Tool:** A read-only survival library.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **Naloxone Guide:** Simple, illustrated, step-by-step guide on how to
    administer Narcan. (Cached offline).
  - **Fentanyl Check:** Instructions on how to properly use test strips.
  - **"The Good Samaritan" Card:** A summary of **Tennessee's Good Samaritan
    Law** (which protects people who call 911 for an OD from arrest). This
    combats the fear of calling for help.

### 4. "The Compassionate U-Turn" (Relapse Protocol)

- **The Concept:** The "Reset Counter" moment is where most users rage-quit
  because of shame. We need to reframe it from "Failure" to "Data."
- **The Tool:** A relapse debriefing wizard.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **The Prompt:** Instead of "Reset to 0," it asks: _"Do you want to start a
    new streak?"_
  - **The Safety Check:** First question: _"Are you safe right now? Do you need
    medical detox?"_
  - **The Data Collection:** _"What happened 1 hour before?"_ (Logs the
    trigger).
  - **The Reframing:** It archives the old streak as a "Chapter" in their
    history, rather than deleting it. _"You didn't lose those 30 days. They are
    part of your story."_

## Part 2: New Ideas (Safety & Harm Reduction)

### 5. "The Canary" (The Slippery Place Timer)

- **The Concept:** A user has to go to a wedding, a bar for a work event, or a
  family holiday dinner (high-risk zones). They are afraid they might slip.
- **The Tool:** A dead-man's switch timer.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Setup:** User sets a timer: _"I will check in every 60 minutes."_
  - **The Check:** The app buzzes. User taps "I'm Okay."
  - **The Alarm:** If user _misses_ the check-in by 15 minutes, the app
    automatically texts their Sponsor/Partner: _"Alert: [User] missed a safety
    check-in at [Location]. Please call them."_

### 6. "The Medical ID" (MAT & Recovery Context)

- **The Concept:** If a user is unconscious or in an accident, EMTs need to know
  they are in recovery to avoid giving them addictive narcotics, or to know they
  are on Suboxone/Vivitrol (which blocks opioids).
- **The Tool:** A lock-screen wallpaper generator or digital card.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Data:** "I am in Recovery. Please avoid Opiates if possible." OR "I am
    prescribed Suboxone."
  - **The Contacts:** Sponsor and Doctor phone numbers.
  - **The Format:** Exports an image to set as the phone's lock screen wallpaper
    so first responders see it immediately.

### 7. "Never Use Alone" (Virtual Spotter)

- **The Concept:** Using alone is the primary cause of fatal overdoses. Users
  feel too much shame to ask a friend to watch them.
- **The Tool:** Direct integration with the **Never Use Alone** hotline (or
  similar services).
- **Feature:**
  - **The Button:** A discrete link in the "Locker" module.
  - **The Function:** Connects to a toll-free number where an operator stays on
    the line while the user uses. If the user stops responding, the operator
    calls EMS to the user's location.
  - **Framing:** Presented neutrally: _"If you are going to use, please do
    this."_

### 8. "The Exit Strategy" (Social Script Generator)

- **The Concept:** Peer pressure is deadly. Newcomers often relapse because they
  don't know _how_ to leave a party or turn down a drink without being awkward.
- **The Tool:** A excuses generator.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Menu:** "I need to leave..." [Work Event] [Date] [Party] [Family].
  - **The Scripts:**
    - _"I have an early morning tomorrow."_
    - _"I'm not feeling well."_
    - _"I have to walk my dog."_
    - _"My sponsor needs me."_ (The "Get out of Jail Free" card).
  - **The Fake Call:** A button that makes the user's phone ring in 30 seconds
    (simulated call) so they can answer it and excuse themselves.

### 9. "The Detox Navigator" (Nashville Specific)

- **The Concept:** If a user is drunk/high and wants to stop _right now_, they
  can't go to a sober living (requires being sober). They need medical detox.
- **The Tool:** A live directory of intake centers.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Map:** Shows Nashville Detox Centers vs. ERs.
  - **The Info:** "Accepts Uninsured?" "Walk-ins?" "24/7 Intake?"
  - **The Transport:** Integration with Uber/Lyft to "Take me to Detox"
    (pre-filled destination).

### 10. "Double-Check" (Pattern Detection Alert)

- **The Concept:** Relapse often happens days before the actual use. The app can
  see the signs even if the user denies them.
- **The Tool:** Algorithmic safety nudges.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Trigger:** If the user stops logging meetings + logs "Anxious" mood +
    stops journaling for 3 days.
  - **The Nudge:** A gentle notification: _"We haven't seen you in a few days.
    Everything okay?"_
  - **The Offer:** _"Click here to just send a thumbs up to your sponsor."_
