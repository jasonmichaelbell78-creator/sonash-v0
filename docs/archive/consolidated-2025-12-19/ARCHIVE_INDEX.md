## 🔍 Finding Information

### Before Consolidation
"Where's the roadmap?" → Check ROADMAP_V3.md  
"How do I set up?" → Scattered across README.md and multiple docs  
"What's the journal architecture?" → UNIFIED_JOURNAL_ARCHITECTURE.md  
"What features are planned?" → FEATURE_DECISIONS.md + ROADMAP_V3.md  

### After Consolidation
"Where's the roadmap?" → [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md)  
"How do I set up?" → [DEVELOPMENT.md](../../DEVELOPMENT.md)  
"What's the journal architecture?" → [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md)  
"What features are planned?" → [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md)
