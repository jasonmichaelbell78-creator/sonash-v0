## Archiving Policy

Documents are archived when they meet one or more of these criteria:
1. **Completed one-time tasks** - Setup guides, diagnostic reports, migration plans
2. **Outdated information** - Superseded by newer versions or subsequent work
3. **Historical snapshots** - Point-in-time analyses preserved for reference
4. **Duplicate content** - Redundant files that add confusion

Documents remain active when they are:
1. **Living references** - Continuously updated or referenced
2. **Operational guides** - Incident response, security procedures
3. **Active planning** - Current roadmap, feature decisions, ongoing research

## Notes

- All archived documents are preserved in git history
- Archive dates reflect when documents were completed or superseded, not necessarily when they were moved
- Cross-references in active documents have been updated where necessary
