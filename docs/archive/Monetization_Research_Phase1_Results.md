# MONETIZATION RESEARCH

## Section 1: Monetization Models

### 1) Freemium (free core + paid upgrades)

**Description:** Keep core utilities free; charge for advanced depth +
convenience (Step 4 “power tools,” analytics, offline, backup/sync, premium
library features).

- **Pros:** Lowest barrier; best trust builder in AA/NA-adjacent culture; easier
  adoption/word-of-mouth.
- **Cons:** Conversion can be low; paywall placement is ethically sensitive;
  free users still cost money.

**Web-verified examples**

- **I Am Sober:** free core; “Sober Plus” IAPs include $9.99/month and
  $39.99/year on iOS.
  [App Store+1](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/i-am-sober/id672904239)
- **Sober Time:** iOS IAPs include Premium Monthly $4.99 and Premium Annual
  $29.99.
  [App Store+1](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sober-time-sobriety-counter/id1158895079)
- **12 Step Toolkit:** positions itself as “completely free” with subscriptions
  and a lifetime plan on its site; iOS listing shows multiple
  subscription/unlock IAPs. [12 Step Toolkit+1](https://12steptoolkit.com/)

**AI-cited examples (unverified)**

- Sober Grid (freemium/community + paid coaching), Nomo (free clocks + paid
  features), various AA “Big Book companion” apps.

---

### 2) Subscription (monthly/annual)

**Description:** Recurring premium tier for ongoing value (new content drops,
deeper insights, advanced tools, moderation/community features).

- **Pros:** Predictable revenue; best for long-term feature/content development;
  aligns with an ongoing recovery journey.
- **Cons:** Churn (relapse/disengagement); recurring charges can feel
  exploitative if cancellations/renewals are aggressive.

**Web-verified examples**

- **Reframe:** pricing varies; Reframe’s help page says “about $100/year on
  average,” and third-party reviews commonly cite $99.99/year for base access.
  [Reframe App+1](https://www.joinreframeapp.com/help/pricing-and-subscription)
- **Loosid:** free to use; premium subscription $20/month and they mention
  financial assistance/scholarships. [Loosid+1](https://loosidapp.com/faq/)
- **Headspace consumer subscription:** annual $69.99 USD after free trial
  (consumer-side). [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/subscriptions)

**AI-cited examples (unverified)**

- “Sober One,” “Twenty-Four Hours a Day” subscription, various recovery coaching
  add-ons.

---

### 3) One-time purchase (lifetime unlock / paid packs / convenience unlocks)

**Description:** Single payment for lifetime access to certain toolkits or
convenience packs (offline mode, playlists, transcripts, specialty inventory
formats).

- **Pros:** Simple/transparent; avoids subscription fatigue; good for stable
  “toolkit” value.
- **Cons:** Harder to sustain ongoing hosting/content costs unless paired with
  add-on packs or another revenue stream.

**Web-verified examples**

- **Calm:** offers “Lifetime” access as a one-time payment (Apple App Store
  listing mentions a Lifetime option; Calm’s own plan page and support FAQ also
  describe a lifetime membership).
  [App Store+2, Calm+2](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/calm/id571800810)
- **12 Step Toolkit:** iOS listing includes multiple non-monthly “unlock” style
  IAPs in addition to subscriptions.
  [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/12-step-toolkit/id1452072215)

**AI-cited examples (unverified)**

- “AA Speaker Tapes” paid packs, “12 Steps AA Companion” one-time purchase,
  “SoberTool” lifetime unlock.

---

### 4) Donations / Pay-what-you-want (“7th Tradition” style)

**Description:** Keep the app usable for free; ask for optional support (often
framed as “help us keep it going”).

- **Pros:** Strong cultural fit; highest trust if executed gently; no access
  barrier for financially strained users.
- **Cons:** Unpredictable; usually insufficient alone for feature-heavy apps
  (especially audio hosting).

**Web-verified examples**

- **12 Step Toolkit** explicitly frames subscriptions as “support us whenever
  you can,” and mentions a lifetime plan if you can’t afford subscriptions.
  [12 Step Toolkit](https://12steptoolkit.com/)

**AI-cited examples (unverified)**

- “AA Meeting Guide supported by 7th Tradition contributions,” various
  donation-based Big Book readers.

---

### 5) B2B licensing (treatment centers, sober living, payers, employers)

**Description:** Sell bulk seats / white-label/co-branded versions to
organizations; may include dashboards, reporting, integrations.

- **Pros:** Higher contract value + stability; organizations subsidize access
  for individuals; can solve some distribution/onboarding.
- **Cons:** Long sales cycles; customization and compliance burden;
  outcomes/reporting expectations.

**Web-verified examples**

- **WEconnect Health:** positions offerings for individuals, employers, and
  health plans/providers. [WeConnect Health+1](https://www.weconnecthealth.io/)
- **CHESS Health:** markets evidence-based SUD digital solutions for
  providers/health plans/public sector.
  [CHESS Health+1](https://www.chess.health/)
- **Calm for Organizations and Headspace for Organizations:** clear enterprise
  distribution models.
  [Calm Health+1](https://health.calm.com/calm-for-organizations/)

**AI-cited examples (unverified)**

- “Sobriety Hub” for sober living management, various EAP vendors.

---

### 6) Affiliate / referral revenue

**Description:** Earn commission by recommending vetted books/resources/tools
(kept conservative to protect trust).

- **Pros:** Monetizes without paywalling core recovery utilities; can subsidize
  free tier.
- **Cons:** Trust risk if it feels salesy or misaligned.

**Web-verified examples**

- None included in the model outputs so far (we can verify later if you want).

**AI-cited examples (unverified)**

- Kimi K2 suggested affiliate revenue for ethically vetted resources.

---

## Open Questions Log — Section 1: Monetization Models

1.  **Will the app include human support (coaching/peer mentors/sponsor-style
    chat), or be self-guided only?**
    - _Why it matters:_ Pricing + liability + moderation + scope of “what users
      think they’re paying for.” (Also changes what B2B buyers expect.)
2.  **Positioning: strictly AA/NA-tradition-aligned vs “recovery-friendly”
    wellness product?**
    - _Why it matters:_ Determines how aggressive you can be with paywalls,
      marketing tone, and what “acceptable” monetization looks like culturally.
3.  **Will you offer a compassionate-access / scholarship path for premium?**
    - _Why it matters:_ Multiple models framed this as the key pressure-release
      valve that prevents backlash against subscriptions.
4.  **Do you want a “lifetime unlock” tier, and if so, what exactly is
    included?**
    - _Why it matters:_ Avoids future conflict around server-heavy features
      (audio hosting, sync) and sets expectations cleanly.
5.  **B2B scope: do you want B2B as one tier, or split offers by customer type
    (treatment centers vs payers vs employers)?**
    - _Why it matters:_ Sales cycle, compliance, and feature requirements differ
      dramatically by segment.
6.  **If B2B is in scope, what is your credibility plan (case studies, outcomes
    data, pilots)?**
    - _Why it matters:_ Many org buyers require evidence and reporting; this
      affects product roadmap and instrumentation.
7.  **For-profit vs nonprofit structure (or hybrid)?**
    - _Why it matters:_ Impacts donation framing, grant eligibility, trust
      signals, and operating constraints.

## Section 2: Ethics and Recovery Culture — Final (aggregated + deduped)

### Ethical framing the community expects

- **Hard line:** No one should be blocked from core recovery help because they
  can’t pay. (multiple sources)
- **Safe monetization frame:** Charge for convenience, personalization, depth,
  premium delivery—not “access to recovery.”
- **Be radically transparent about money + privacy/data.** In this space,
  anonymity = safety, not a “nice-to-have.”
- **Useful gut-checks repeatedly suggested:**
  - “Would I feel okay saying this out loud at a meeting / group conscience?”
  - “If someone is broke this week, can they still get help fast?”

### Always-free highlights (callout, not a new bucket)

Across all sources, the “do not paywall” consensus centers on:

- Meeting finder (search, maps, filters, contact/links)
- Crisis / SOS / Help-now (hotlines, sponsor call list, emergency resources)
- Basic sobriety counter + chips/milestones
- Basic journaling + daily check-in + simple mood tracking
- Starter prayers/readings (enough to keep the app useful)
- Privacy controls + data control (anonymous use, delete/export your data)

### Tradition 7 and recovery culture applied to an app

- Your app is typically viewed as an “outside enterprise” relative to AA/NA—not
  bound by traditions, but your users live by them.
- The “self-supporting” spirit translates best as:
  - Users voluntarily supporting the tool (hosting/dev/curation), not “buying
    recovery.”
  - Avoiding outside money that creates obligations (e.g., predatory
    advertisers, referral kickbacks).
- Community sensitivity spikes if you:
  - imply official affiliation/endorsement, or
  - commercialize things that feel like “the meeting in your pocket.”

### What the community usually finds acceptable

- **Freemium with ethics:** Core recovery utilities free; premium is genuinely
  “extra.”
- **Low-pressure subscriptions:** Clear value-added features (advanced inventory
  formats, deep analytics, offline mode, cloud sync).
- **Donations / “pay it forward” framing:** Optional contributions that help
  keep core tools free.
- **B2B licensing (done clean):** Programs pay for admin/reporting layers while
  clients keep core access—as long as it doesn’t become surveillance or
  brokering.
- **Ads (only if very careful):** Non-intrusive, easy-to-remove, and
  context-safe (many sources still advise avoiding ads entirely).

### What tends to feel exploitative

The main tripwires that repeatedly showed up:

- Paywalling essentials (meetings, SOS, sobriety counter, basic
  readings/prayers, core journaling)
- Crisis gatekeeping (anything that blocks immediate help)
- Data monetization (selling/sharing sensitive recovery data; heavy ad
  tracking/pixels)
- Patient brokering / lead-gen kickbacks (steering users to treatment for a
  payout)
- Dark patterns (trial traps, hard cancellation, manipulative upsells)
- Milestone-based monetization pressure (e.g., “unlock your 1-year chip…” framed
  in a shamey way)
- Paid “sponsor matching” presented as sponsorship (seen as commercializing
  fellowship guidance)
- Two-tier recovery design (free tier feels intentionally crippled where it
  matters)

### Balancing sustainability with accessibility

Patterns that consistently came up as “ethical + practical”:

- **Scholarship/compassionate access:** “If you can’t pay, you still get Pro.”
  (Best practice: keep it low-friction and dignity-preserving.)
- **Sponsor-a-member / community fund:** Let paying users fund premium access
  for others.
- **Sliding scale / regional pricing / discounts:** Especially for annual plans.
- **B2B subsidizes B2C:** Programs pay for advanced admin/reporting; individuals
  keep core tools free.
- **Cost-control by design:** Offline-first journaling; minimal data collection;
  paid-only cloud features if needed.
- **Data portability as ethics:** Free export/backup of
  journals/inventories/milestones to avoid “data hostage” dynamics.

### Privacy, safety, and operational guardrails

- **Privacy posture:** “No selling health data” and “no ad trackers” is the
  trust baseline in this category.
- If you ever support B2B dashboards, the ethics bar rises: Clear consent,
  role-based access, and strict data minimization.
- If you add community features, ethics becomes operations: Moderation,
  reporting tools, trigger-content rules, and safety workflows aren’t optional.

### Examples of apps getting it wrong (AI-cited, unverified)

_(Consolidated list of patterns and named items mentioned by AIs)_

- Privacy/data sharing for advertising (FTC-allegation-style examples).
- Predatory rehab referral ecosystems / kickbacks / patient brokering.
- Paywalling crisis features (e.g., “panic button behind paywall”).
- Degrading free meeting accuracy to force upgrades.
- Charging per chip / per celebration.
- Relapse prediction behind paywall.
- Paid “certified sponsor” access.
- Low-quality apps stuffed with ads that funnel to one treatment program.

### Section 2 summary

- Keep meetings, SOS/help-now, basic tracking, basic journaling, starter
  readings, and privacy/data controls always free.
- Monetize depth + convenience (Step 4 “power tools,” advanced analytics,
  offline features, cloud sync, premium organization).
- The fastest way to lose trust is data monetization, crisis gatekeeping,
  kickbacks, or dark patterns.
- “Accessibility + sustainability” is best handled via scholarship access +
  pay-it-forward framing + B2B subsidy, plus data portability so users never
  feel trapped.

## Open Questions Log — Section 2: Ethics and Recovery Culture

1.  **Community/social features or personal tools only?**
    - _Why:_ Drives moderation/safety obligations, costs, and ethics risk
      surface.
2.  **Will you include a Panic/SOS / crisis-contact feature?**
    - _Why:_ If yes, it must be prominent + free; also affects UX and safety
      expectations.
3.  **What is your exact “must-be-free” minimum promise?**
    - _Why:_ This defines whether monetization is viewed as supportive vs
      exploitative.
4.  **Will cloud backup/sync be free, paid, or hybrid?**
    - _Why:_ Paid sync can feel like ransoming recovery history; free sync adds
      ongoing cost.
5.  **What is your data portability guarantee for free users (export/local
    backup/transfer)?**
    - _Why:_ Prevents “data hostage” dynamics; affects architecture + paywall
      boundaries.
6.  **Branding stance: “AA/NA focused” vs “12-step inspired” vs
    “recovery-friendly”?**
    - _Why:_ Sets expectations, scrutiny, and how carefully you must avoid
      implied affiliation.
7.  **Will you offer compassionate access/scholarship—and how frictionless will
    it be?**
    - _Why:_ Repeatedly cited as the trust release valve for subscriptions.
8.  **Will you ever change what’s free vs paid? What’s your “no rug-pull”
    policy?**
    - _Why:_ Moving core features behind paywalls is a major backlash trigger.
9.  **Ads: Will you use them at all—and what categories are banned?**
    - _Why:_ “Normal ads” can be harmful in recovery contexts; define bans
      early.
10. **Privacy posture: hard rule of no selling/sharing sensitive data and no ad
    trackers?**
    - _Why:_ Anonymity is central to trust; violations are reputation-ending.
11. **If B2B exists, what data (if any) leaves the user and who can see it?**
    - _Why:_ Consent + RBAC + minimization; determines whether B2B becomes
      surveillance.
12. **If you offer paid coaching/guidance, will it be credentialed—and how will
    you describe it?**
    - _Why:_ “Unqualified advice for pay” is flagged as exploitative; impacts
      liability and product scope.
13. **Will you make efficacy/outcomes claims in marketing/app store copy?**
    - _Why:_ High-risk area for misleading claims; influences copy standards and
      substantiation.
14. **If you pursue grants/foundation funding, what sources are acceptable under
    your ethics policy?**
    - _Why:_ Funding can subsidize access, but can create outside-influence
      optics.
15. **What is your stance on VC/outside investors (if any)?**
    - _Why:_ Several sources flag investor incentives pushing predatory
      monetization.
16. **If B2B, what are your partner ethics criteria and disqualifiers?**
    - _Why:_ Protects users and prevents sliding into kickbacks/brokering.
17. **Will you accept any referral fees/kickbacks from partners (even
    “vetted”)?**
    - _Why:_ This is treated as a bright-line ethical boundary in multiple
      inputs.
18. **How will you moderate community spaces to prevent triggering content and
    protect vulnerable users?**
    - _Why:_ Unmoderated communities are repeatedly cited as a harm vector.
19. **What’s your default transparency policy (how money is used, pricing
    clarity, cancellation simplicity)?**
    - _Why:_ Transparency repeatedly shows up as the core trust builder in this
      niche.

## Section 3 — Legal and Compliance (US-only)

### 1) HIPAA and health data (does journaling about recovery count?)

- The journaling absolutely can be “health data” in the ordinary sense.
- HIPAA applies based on who you are and who you’re serving, not just the
  sensitivity of the text. If you are not a “covered entity”
  (provider/plan/clearinghouse) and not acting as a business associate for one,
  HIPAA usually does not apply.
  [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/)
- If you partner with a treatment provider and handle data on their behalf, you
  may become a business associate and need a BAA + HIPAA security program.
  [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/)
- **Often-missed related rule (US): 42 CFR Part 2.** If you become part of a
  federally assisted SUD treatment program workflow, Part 2 can restrict
  disclosure of substance-use treatment records.
  [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118223)
- **Practical rule:** Build as if recovery journaling is ultra-sensitive even if
  HIPAA doesn’t apply (data minimization, encryption, strict vendor controls).

### 2) FTC health-app enforcement risk (applies even when HIPAA doesn’t)

- If your app collects recovery-related data, the FTC Health Breach Notification
  Rule can apply to health apps not covered by HIPAA.
  [Apple Support+1](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118428)
- Key takeaway: “breach” risk isn’t only hacking — it can also involve
  unauthorized disclosure inconsistent with what you promised users.
  [New York State Senate](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/GBS/527-A)

### 3) Payment processing for subscriptions (Apple/Google requirements)

- **Apple (iOS):** Digital subscriptions/features consumed in the app generally
  must use Apple In-App Purchase under App Store rules.
  [HHS+1](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/business-associates/index.html)
- **Google Play (Android):** Digital goods/subscriptions in Play-distributed
  apps generally must use Google Play Billing.
  [California DOJ+1](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-issues-consumer-alert-california%E2%80%99s-automatic-renewal-law)
- _Why this matters:_ It affects your pricing, refund flow, and what
  cancellation experience you can control.

### 4) Subscription auto-renewal laws (US-only)

Baseline you should engineer for:

- Clear, conspicuous disclosure of renewal terms before purchase.
- Affirmative consent to recurring charges.
- Simple way to stop recurring charges.
- **Major federal baseline:** ROSCA (Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act).
  [Congress.gov+1](https://www.congress.gov/111/plaws/publ345/PLAW-111publ345.pdf)
- **State laws:** CA and NY are commonly treated as “design-to-this-standard”
  states.
  [Perkins Coie+1](https://perkinscoie.com/insights/update/new-york-and-colorado-update-auto-renewing-subscription-requirements)
- **Important:** FTC “click-to-cancel” rule status is fluid, but state ARLs +
  ROSCA remain.
  [WilmerHale+1](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/insights/client-alerts/20250801-eighth-circuit-vacates-the-ftcs-click-to-cancel-rule-but-federal-and-state-regulators-likely-to-remain-active)

### 5) Right to refund and cancellation requirements

- If you sell through Apple IAP, users generally manage cancellations in Apple’s
  subscription UI.
  [Google Help+1](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10281818)
- If you sell through Google Play Billing, Google controls much of the
  refund/cancel flows.
  [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/us-click-cancel-rule-blocked-by-appeals-court-2025-07-08/)
- **Practical recommendation:** Even if stores handle billing, maintain a clear
  “Billing help” support path and an internal discretionary refund policy.

### 6) Terms of Service requirements

Big must-haves for a recovery app:

- Not medical care / not emergency services disclaimer.
- No guarantee of outcomes (avoid “treatment claims”).
- Subscription terms (price, renewal, cancellation, refunds).
- User content terms (journals/messages ownership + license to host/process).
- Limits of liability + dispute terms.
- Community rules if you have social features.

### 7) Privacy policy requirements for paid features

Two “rules of thumb” that keep you out of trouble:

1.  Say what you do, do what you say (especially about sharing with third
    parties).
2.  Treat recovery data as sensitive by default (and avoid ad-tech sharing).

- FTC enforcement posture around health apps makes this especially important.
  [Apple Support+1](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118428)

### 8) Tax implications of app revenue (US-only, high-level)

- App revenue is generally taxable income; entity choice matters.
- Platforms may issue tax forms (1099-K) depending on thresholds ($5,000
  threshold for tax year 2024 as part of phase-in).
  [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-announces-2023-form-1099-k-reporting-threshold-delay-for-third-party-platform-payments-plans-for-a-5000-threshold-in-2024-to-phase-in-implementation)
- Apple/Google often handle sales-tax/VAT mechanics, but confirm reporting
  obligations with an accountant.

### Items from earlier model outputs marked “Unverified”

- Exact effective dates for specific state ARL updates.
- Specific platform details like “must support Family Sharing” or exact refund
  windows.
- Any “this app did X and got backlash” claims without a solid source.

### Question log for Section 3

1.  **Will this be strictly B2C, or will you license to treatment providers?**
    - _Why:_ Triggers HIPAA/BAA and 42 CFR Part 2 requirements.
      [Apple Support+1](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118223)
2.  **Will you sell paid access only through IAP, or also via web checkout?**
    - _Why:_ Web sales shift cancellation/refund/tax burden to you.
      [HHS+1](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/business-associates/index.html)
3.  **Will you use any third-party analytics/ads SDKs?**
    - _Why:_ Major FTC enforcement risk (Health Breach Notification Rule).
      [Apple Support+1](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118428)
4.  **Will you offer community features?**
    - _Why:_ Adds moderation + safety obligations.
5.  **Do you allow minors?**
    - _Why:_ COPPA/age-gating and platform policies become a big compliance
      project.

- **North America (day 35):** Upper quartile ~5.5%, P90 ~10.5%.
  [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/state-of-subscription-apps-2025/)

### 5) Churn rate benchmarks (RevenueCat 2025)

- Nearly 30% of annual subscriptions are canceled in the first month.
  [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/state-of-subscription-apps-2025/)
- ~36% still subscribed after a year for “cheap annual plans.”
  [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/state-of-subscription-apps-2025/)

### Section 4 Summary

US recovery apps broadly anchor premium pricing around $9.99/month, with
aggressive annual pricing in the $29.99–$79.99/year band. Business metrics rely
on broader subscription benchmarks: freemium median day-35 conversion is ~2.18%
(vs ~12.11% for hard paywalls), and ~30% of annual subs cancel in the first
month. [App Store+2](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/i-am-sober/id672904239)

## Section 5 — Cost Analysis Framework

### Assumptions

- “Users” = monthly active users (MAU).
- Region examples use Firestore us-central1 (Iowa).
  [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/pricing)

### Question Log (Section 5)

1.  **100 / 1K / 10K / 100K users:** Do you mean MAU, DAU, or total installs?
2.  **Speaker tapes:** What’s your “average listening per MAU per month”? (Main
    bandwidth cost).
3.  **Offline downloads allowed?** (Multiplies bandwidth).
4.  **Auth method:** Phone-number sign-in (SMS) or email/Apple/Google? (SMS
    costs scale differently).

5.  **Fixed burn:** What is your intended monthly budget for people/marketing?

### 1) Firebase costs at different user scales

- **Firestore unit costs:** Reads $0.03/100k; Writes $0.09/100k; Storage
  $0.18/GB-month. [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/pricing)
- **Free tier:** 50k reads/day, 20k writes/day, 1GB storage.
  [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/products/firestore)
- **Cost impact:**
  - **100 MAU:** Likely free.
    [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/products/firestore)
  - **100k MAU:** Low hundreds/month for Firestore itself.

### 2) Audio streaming costs (The scalable cost)

- **Bandwidth math:** 64 kbps voice ≈ 28.8 MB/hour.
- **Cost estimate:** If delivery is ~$0.12/GB (Firebase legacy), 100k listening
  hours ≈ $346/month. [Firebase+1](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)
- **Egress-free option:** Cloudflare R2 ($0.015/GB-month storage, free egress).

### 5) Break-even analysis

- **Break-even paying users** = (monthly fixed burn) ÷ (net revenue per payer).
- **Key inputs needed:** Fixed burn target, conversion rate assumption, store
  fee path.

### Section 5 Summary

Infrastructure costs for a text-first recovery app (Firestore + Functions) are
generally low due to free tiers and low unit pricing.
[Google Cloud+2](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/pricing) Audio delivery is
the main variable cost, which can be mitigated using egress-free storage like
Cloudflare R2.
[Cloudflare Docs+1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/) Real budget
drivers will be development, maintenance, and support.
