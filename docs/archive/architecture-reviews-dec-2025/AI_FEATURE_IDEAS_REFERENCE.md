## Analysis Methodology

### Process

1. **Ingest**: Received 150+ feature ideas organized into 16 thematic categories
2. **Parse**: Extracted each individual feature with its description and flags
3. **Cross-Reference**: Compared each feature against
   [ROADMAP_V3.md](file:///c:/Users/jason/Workspace/dev-projects/sonash-v0/ROADMAP_V3.md)
   milestones M1-M8
4. **Categorize**: Assigned each to one of four categories based on overlap and
   feasibility
5. **Annotate**: Added effort estimates and milestone recommendations for new
   ideas
