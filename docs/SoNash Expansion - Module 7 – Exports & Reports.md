# SoNash Expansion: Module 7 – Exports & Reports

**Core Philosophy:** "Your Data, Your Evidence."
Whether it’s showing a court officer you attended 90 meetings, handing a sponsor your 4th Step, or just backing up your life, the user owns the data. We provide the tools to format it for the specific audience that needs to see it.

## Part 1: Expansions of Existing Ideas

### 1. The "Recovery Resume" (Verification Report)

* **The Concept:** Users in sober living, probation, or custody disputes often need *proof* of their recovery work. A generic app screenshot doesn't look official.
* **The Tool:** A professional, formatted PDF report.
* **Expanded Feature:**
  * **The Content:** A chronologically sorted list of "Verified Actions":
    * Meeting Attendance (Date, Time, Location).
    * Service Work Hours.
    * "Clean Time" Statement.
  * **The Formatting:** Clean, bureaucratic layout (looks like a bank statement, not a diary).
  * **The "Signature" Line:** A space at the bottom for a sponsor or house manager to physically sign, adding validity.

### 2. "Step Packets" (The Digital Binder)

* **The Concept:** Steps 4 and 8 are lists. Steps 1, 2, and 3 are writing. Sponsors often want to read these with a red pen in hand, not scrolling on a phone.
* **The Tool:** Step-specific PDF generators.
* **Expanded Feature:**
  * **The "Workbook" Mode:** Generates a PDF where the user's answers are typed, but wide margins are left on the side for the sponsor's handwritten notes.
  * **The "Blank" Mode:** Generates the empty worksheets with the prompt questions, so the user can fill them out by hand (pen and paper) if they prefer analog writing.
  * **Safety:** Automatic "CONFIDENTIAL" watermark on every page.

### 3. The "Sponsor's Cheat Sheet" (Summary View)

* **The Concept:** Sponsors are busy. They don't have time to read 30 days of journaling. They need the headlines.
* **The Tool:** A 1-page executive summary.
* **Expanded Feature:**
  * **The "Vitals":**
    * Meetings this month: [12]
    * Step Work status: [Working Step 4]
    * Top Mood Tags: [Anxious, Grateful]
  * **The "Red Flags" Section:** (Optional) "Days with high 'Craving' tags."
  * **The "Discussion Starters":** 3 bullet points drawn from the "Parking Lot" module (e.g., "Ask about resentment at work").

### 4. The "Emergency Wallet Card" (Physical Anchor)

* **The Concept:** When a phone dies or is lost, an addict loses their lifeline. This is the analog backup.
* **The Tool:** A print-and-fold pocket card generator.
* **Expanded Feature:**
  * **The Front:** "I am in recovery. In case of emergency, please call:" (Sponsor, Partner, House Manager).
  * **The Back:** The User's "Relapse Prevention Plan" (3 steps: Breathe, Call X, Go to Y).
  * **Medical Info:** Optional section for "Medically Assisted Treatment (MAT)" details to prevent dangerous drug interactions if hospitalized.

### 5. The "Full Archive" (Data Sovereignty)

* **The Concept:** Users fear locking their life story into an app that might disappear.
* **The Tool:** A standardized export format.
* **Expanded Feature:**
  * **JSON:** For tech-savvy users or importing into other tools.
  * **CSV:** For opening in Excel/Google Sheets (useful for analyzing one's own mood data).
  * **Plain Text:** A readable, non-formatted dump of every journal entry, organized by date.

### 6. The "30-Day Retrospective" (Self-Review)

* **The Concept:** Growth is slow. Users feel like they aren't making progress.
* **The Tool:** A generated "Monthly Magazine" of their own life.
* **Expanded Feature:**
  * **"Best Of":** Highlights the 3 days with the highest "Serenity" or "Gratitude" ratings.
  * **"The Struggle":** Highlights a challenge they wrote about on Day 1 that is now resolved on Day 30.
  * **Visual:** Includes a calendar heatmap of their mood for the month.

## Part 2: New Ideas (Exports & Reports)

### 7. "The Clinical Hand-Off" (Therapist Report)

* **The Concept:** Users often see a therapist for depression/anxiety alongside recovery. The therapist needs different data than a sponsor.
* **The Tool:** A specialized export for medical/clinical professionals.
* **Feature:**
  * **What it Includes:** Mood charts, Sleep logs, Medication adherence (if tracked), Anxiety frequency.
  * **What it Excludes:** The *content* of the 4th Step (resentments/fears) and spiritual reflections.
  * **Why:** Bridges the gap between "Recovery" and "Mental Health" without oversharing private confessions.

### 8. "The Amends Ledger" (Spreadsheet Export)

* **The Concept:** Step 8/9 is a project management task. Managing 50 amends on a phone screen is a nightmare.
* **The Tool:** A formatted Excel/CSV specifically for Step 9.
* **Feature:**
  * **Columns:** Person, Nature of Harm, Type of Amends (Direct/Living), Status (Ready, Scheduled, Done), Cost ($), Outcome Notes.
  * **Why:** Allows the user to manage the logistics of restitution on a desktop computer, which is often less emotional and more practical.

### 9. "Milestone Certificates" (Printable Celebrations)

* **The Concept:** Not everyone can get to a meeting to get a chip/keytag. Some users are remote or housebound.
* **The Tool:** A certificate generator.
* **Feature:**
  * **Design:** Clean, dignified designs (not cartoony) for 30 Days, 60 Days, 1 Year, etc.
  * **Customization:** User can add their "Clean Date" and a favorite quote.
  * **Use Case:** Users print these to hang on their fridge or wall as a physical reminder of success.

### 10. "The Service Log" (Volunteer Proof)

* **The Concept:** Some courts or sober living houses require "Community Service" hours, distinct from meeting attendance.
* **The Tool:** A timesheet export.
* **Feature:**
  * **Format:** Date | Activity (e.g., "Cleaned Hall," "Chaired Meeting") | Duration | Signature Line.
  * **Why:** Distinct from the "Meeting Attendance" log, focusing specifically on *work performed*.

### 11. "The Incident Report" (Relapse Analysis)

* **The Concept:** If a relapse happens, the data leading up to it is a goldmine for prevention.
* **The Tool:** A "Black Box" export.
* **Feature:**
  * **Trigger:** User selects a "Relapse Date."
  * **The Output:** A report showing the 14 days *prior* to that date: Mood trends, meeting attendance drops, sleep changes, keyword usage (e.g., "tired," "angry").
  * **Use Case:** The user takes this to their sponsor/therapist to "autopsy" the relapse and find the exact moment they went off track.
