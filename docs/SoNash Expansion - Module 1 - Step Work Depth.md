**Tech Stack Approach:** "Vibe Coder" (Start as text/forms -> Upgrade to
interactive UI).

---

## Step 1: Honesty – The Admission

**Principle:** _Honesty_ | **Focus:** _Admitting powerlessness &
unmanageability._

### 1. Principle Task: "Defining Honesty" Reflection

- **The Task:** A simple prompt asking: _"What is the difference between
  'telling the truth' and 'being honest'?"_
- **Interaction:** A split screen showing "Old Definition" (e.g., Not getting
  caught) vs. "New Definition" (e.g., Being real with myself).
- **Why:** Re-frames honesty as an internal act of courage, not just an external
  legal confession.

### 2. The "Unmanageability Map" (Interactive Canvas)

- **The Tool:** A visual interface where users map addiction's impact on 4
  areas: **Body**, **Mind**, **Relationships**, **Wallet**.
- **Action:** Users tap an area to add specific tags (e.g., "Insomnia" under
  Body, "Debt" under Wallet).
- **Output:** A visual "heat map" showing exactly where life has become
  unmanageable.

### 3. The "Powerlessness" Checklist

- **The Tool:** A list of 20 common behaviors associated with loss of control
  (e.g., _Tried to stop and couldn't_, _Hid usage_, _Used when I didn't want
  to_).
- **Action:** User checks off what applies. The visual accumulation of
  checkmarks acts as undeniable data to break denial.

### 4. Cost-Benefit Analysis (The Illusion of Control)

- **The Tool:** A 2-column comparison worksheet.
- **Column A:** "What using did FOR me" (Social ease, Numbing, Sleep).
- **Column B:** "What using cost me" (Trust, Self-respect, Money).
- **Action:** Seeing the "Cost" list physically longer than the "Benefit" list
  is a classic cognitive behavioral tool for acceptance.

---

## Step 2: Hope – The Belief

**Principle:** _Hope_ | **Focus:** _Believing change is possible._

### 1. Principle Task: The "Hope Meter"

- **The Task:** A slider bar (0-100%). Prompt: _"How much do you believe, right
  now, that things can get better?"_
- **Follow-up:** If they drag it to even 1%, the app celebrates: _"1% is all we
  need to start."_

### 2. The "Evidence of Recovery" Log

- **The Tool:** A "Collector" interface to gather external proof.
- **Action:** User logs 3 distinct data points:
  - _A person I know who stayed sober._
  - _A story I heard that resonated._
  - _A moment I survived without using._
- **Why:** Builds a "case file" for hope when the user has none of their own.

### 3. "Defining Sanity" Worksheet

- **The Tool:** A re-framing exercise.
- **Action:** User compares two scenarios:
  - _My Old Reaction:_ (e.g., Screaming, isolating, using).
  - _A Sane Reaction:_ (e.g., Pausing, calling a friend, waiting).
- **Why:** Moves "sanity" from a medical term to a behavioral goal.

### 4. "Tiny Step": The Trust Experiment

- **The Tool:** A 1-hour challenge card.
- **Action:** _"For the next hour, I will act as if everything is going to be
  okay."_ User taps "Start Timer" and journals one sentence when the hour is up.

- **Action:** User sorts cards into **"My Faith IS"** (e.g., Trust, Nature,
  Group, Love) vs. **"My Faith IS NOT"** (e.g., Punishment, Magic, Specific
  Religion).

### 2. The Decision & Values Contract

- **The Tool:** A formal digital document.
- **Action:** User selects 3 core values (e.g., Courage, Truth, Kindness).
- **The Signature:** User digitally signs: _"I decide to turn my will and life
  over to the care of these values/principles as I understand them."_

### 3. Control vs. Release Board

- **The Tool:** A Kanban-style board.
- **Action:** User types in current stressors (e.g., "My rent," "Mom's anger,"
  "My sobriety"). They drag them into **"Can Control"** or **"Cannot Control."**
- **Why:** Visualizes the act of "turning it over."

### 4. "The Help Button" (Digital Surrender)

- **The Tool:** A giant, calm button.
- **Action:** Tapping it logs a timestamped entry: _"I am willing to accept help
  right now."_ It’s a physical action for a spiritual decision.

**Principle:** _Courage_ | **Focus:** _A fearless moral inventory._

### 1. Principle Task: The "Fear vs. Courage" Scale

- **The Task:** A prompt acknowledging fear.

  to build trust).

### 2. The "Blueprint" Wizard (Guided Flow)

- **Why:** Prevents the "blank page panic" of a massive spreadsheet.

### 3. Inventory Variants (The 4 Types)

- **The Tool:** Separate modules for **Resentments**, **Fears**, **Harms**, and
  **Sex/Relationships**.
- **Action:** Each module has specific prompts (e.g., Fear: _"What am I afraid
  of losing?"_ vs. Resentment: _"How was my self-esteem hurt?"_).

### 4. The "Strengths" Inventory (The Balance)
