---

## Step 1: Honesty – The Admission

**Principle:** *Honesty* | **Focus:** *Admitting powerlessness & unmanageability.*

### 1. Principle Task: "Defining Honesty" Reflection

* **The Task:** A simple prompt asking: *"What is the difference between 'telling the truth' and 'being honest'?"*
* **Interaction:** A split screen showing "Old Definition" (e.g., Not getting caught) vs. "New Definition" (e.g., Being real with myself).
* **Why:** Re-frames honesty as an internal act of courage, not just an external legal confession.

### 2. The "Unmanageability Map" (Interactive Canvas)

* **The Tool:** A visual interface where users map addiction's impact on 4 areas: **Body**, **Mind**, **Relationships**, **Wallet**.
* **Action:** Users tap an area to add specific tags (e.g., "Insomnia" under Body, "Debt" under Wallet).
* **Output:** A visual "heat map" showing exactly where life has become unmanageable.

### 3. The "Powerlessness" Checklist

* **The Tool:** A list of 20 common behaviors associated with loss of control (e.g., *Tried to stop and couldn't*, *Hid usage*, *Used when I didn't want to*).
* **Action:** User checks off what applies. The visual accumulation of checkmarks acts as undeniable data to break denial.

### 4. Cost-Benefit Analysis (The Illusion of Control)

* **The Tool:** A 2-column comparison worksheet.
* **Column A:** "What using did FOR me" (Social ease, Numbing, Sleep).
* **Column B:** "What using cost me" (Trust, Self-respect, Money).
* **Action:** Seeing the "Cost" list physically longer than the "Benefit" list is a classic cognitive behavioral tool for acceptance.

## Step 2: Hope – The Belief

**Principle:** *Hope* | **Focus:** *Believing change is possible.*

### 1. Principle Task: The "Hope Meter"

* **The Task:** A slider bar (0-100%). Prompt: *"How much do you believe, right now, that things can get better?"*
* **Follow-up:** If they drag it to even 1%, the app celebrates: *"1% is all we need to start."*

### 2. The "Evidence of Recovery" Log

* **The Tool:** A "Collector" interface to gather external proof.
* **Action:** User logs 3 distinct data points:
  * *A person I know who stayed sober.*
  * *A story I heard that resonated.*
  * *A moment I survived without using.*
* **Why:** Builds a "case file" for hope when the user has none of their own.

### 3. "Defining Sanity" Worksheet

* **The Tool:** A re-framing exercise.
* **Action:** User compares two scenarios:
  * *My Old Reaction:* (e.g., Screaming, isolating, using).
  * *A Sane Reaction:* (e.g., Pausing, calling a friend, waiting).
* **Why:** Moves "sanity" from a medical term to a behavioral goal.

### 4. "Tiny Step": The Trust Experiment

* **The Tool:** A 1-hour challenge card.
* **Action:** *"For the next hour, I will act as if everything is going to be okay."* User taps "Start Timer" and journals one sentence when the hour is up.

---

## Step 3: Faith – The Decision

**Principle:** *Faith* | **Focus:** *Turning it over.*

### 1. Principle Task: "What is Faith?" Sorter

* **The Task:** A drag-and-drop game to de-stigmatize the concept.
* **Action:** User sorts cards into **"My Faith IS"** (e.g., Trust, Nature, Group, Love) vs. **"My Faith IS NOT"** (e.g., Punishment, Magic, Specific Religion).

### 2. The Decision & Values Contract

* **The Tool:** A formal digital document.
* **Action:** User selects 3 core values (e.g., Courage, Truth, Kindness).
* **The Signature:** User digitally signs: *"I decide to turn my will and life over to the care of these values/principles as I understand them."*

### 3. Control vs. Release Board

* **The Tool:** A Kanban-style board.
* **Action:** User types in current stressors (e.g., "My rent," "Mom's anger," "My sobriety"). They drag them into **"Can Control"** or **"Cannot Control."**
* **Why:** Visualizes the act of "turning it over."

### 4. "The Help Button" (Digital Surrender)

* **The Tool:** A giant, calm button.
* **Action:** Tapping it logs a timestamped entry: *"I am willing to accept help right now."* It’s a physical action for a spiritual decision.

## Step 4: Courage – The Inventory

**Principle:** *Courage* | **Focus:** *A fearless moral inventory.*

### 1. Principle Task: The "Fear vs. Courage" Scale

* **The Task:** A prompt acknowledging fear.
* **Prompt:** *"Courage isn't the absence of fear; it's acting despite it. What is one thing you are afraid to write down today?"*
* **Action:** User types it into a "Vanishing Box" (it disappears after typing to build trust).

### 2. The "Blueprint" Wizard (Guided Flow)

* **The Tool:** A step-by-step wizard to prevent overwhelm.
* **Action:** The app asks one question at a time: *"Who?"* → *"What happened?"* → *"How did it affect you?"* → *"What was your part?"*

### 3. Inventory Variants (The 4 Types)

* **The Tool:** Separate modules for **Resentments**, **Fears**, **Harms**, and **Sex/Relationships**.
* **Action:** Each module has specific prompts (e.g., Fear: *"What am I afraid of losing?"* vs. Resentment: *"How was my self-esteem hurt?"*).

### 4. The "Strengths" Inventory (The Balance)

* **The Tool:** A positive inventory list.
* **Action:** User lists 5 times they were brave, kind, or honest.
* **Why:** Reminds the user they are not "all bad"—this requires the courage to accept one's good traits too.

* **Action:** User lists a defect (e.g., Gossiping). Slides bar from 0% ("I love doing this") to 100% ("Take it away now").
* **Why:** Honesty about *low* willingness is the key to this step.

### 4. The "Survival Value" Worksheet

* **The Tool:** A compassion exercise.
