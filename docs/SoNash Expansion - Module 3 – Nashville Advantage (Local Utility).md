**Core Philosophy:** "The Ground Truth." National apps have data; SoNash has
_context_. These tools help users navigate the physical geography of Nashville
while avoiding triggers and finding community.

---

## Part 1: Expansions of Existing Ideas

### 1. "Tonight in Nashville" (The Decision Engine)

- **The Problem:** A standard list of 50 meetings is overwhelming. An addict in
  decision-paralysis needs to be told where to go.
- **The Tool:** A time-sensitive, algorithm-lite suggestion engine.
- **Key Features:**
  - **The "Best Bet" Badge:** Highlights **one** meeting starting in the next 2
    hours based on density/popularity (e.g., "The 7:00 PM at Club 12 is usually
    packed").
  - **The "Rush Hour" Filter:** Filters out meetings that are impossible to get
    to during Nashville traffic (4 PM - 6 PM) based on user location to prevent
    "road rage" triggers.
  - **"Get Me There" Button:** One-tap integration with Uber/Lyft/Maps that
    pre-fills the destination address.
  - **Offline Mode:** Downloads the next 12 hours of meeting data so it works
    even if service cuts out.

### 2. "Safe Spaces" Map (The Third Place)

- **The Problem:** "I have an hour to kill before the meeting, and I can't sit
  in a bar."
- **The Tool:** A map of curated "Third Places" (not home, not work, not a
  meeting).
- **Key Features:**
  - **"Late Night" Filter:** Crucial for Nashville. Highlights coffee shops or
    diners open past 9 PM (rare, but vital for sobriety).
  - **"Step Work Friendly" Tag:** Icons indicating spots that have big tables,
    cheap coffee, and low noise levels (e.g., specific libraries or quiet
    cafes).
  - **"NA Drink" Menu:** Highlights places that serve actual mocktails or decent
    coffee, not just soda gun water.
  - **Trigger Warning:** Notes if a "coffee shop" turns into a "wine bar" at 5
    PM.

### 3. "My Sober Circuit" (Routine Builder)

- **The Problem:** Recovery relies on routine. Users need to reduce friction for
  their regular stops.
- **The Tool:** A "Favorites" system that acts like a personalized itinerary.
- **Key Features:**
  - **"Home Group" Pin:** The user pins their primary meeting. The app tracks
    "Consecutive Weeks Attended" (internal integrity metric).
  - **Routine Stacking:** User can build a "Tuesday Loop" (e.g., Gym -> 5:30 PM
    Meeting -> Diner).
  - **Traffic Alerts:** "Leave now to make the 7:00 PM." (Uses native OS travel
    time APIs).

## Part 2: New Ideas (Nashville Specific)

### 4. "The Meeting-After-The-Meeting" Guide

- **The Concept:** The meeting is where you learn; the parking lot or diner is
  where you heal. In Nashville, specific crowds migrate to specific spots after
  meetings.
- **The Tool:** A "Local Knowledge" tip section attached to major meetings.
- **Key Features:**
  - **The Tip:** "After the Tuesday night men's meeting, the guys usually go to
    [Specific Waffle House]."
  - **Community Sourced (Moderated):** Users can submit tips like "Great parking
    lot for talking," or "Don't rush off, they smoke outside for 30 mins."
  - **Why:** Helps the newcomer break into the social circle, which is the
    hardest part of early recovery.

### 5. The "Broadway Escape Plan" (Tourist/Trigger Mode)

- **The Concept:** Nashville is a party capital. If a user (local or tourist)
  gets stuck downtown (Broadway) surrounded by bachelorette parties and alcohol,
  they need an immediate "out."
- **The Tool:** A panic-navigation feature.
- **Key Features:**
  - **"Get Me Out" Button:** Instantly routes the user to the _nearest_ quiet
    zone (e.g., the library downtown or a quiet hotel lobby) or the nearest
    meeting.
  - **"Safe Corridors":** Maps walking routes that avoid the densest bar
    streets.
  - **Why:** Preventing relapse in high-pressure environments.

### 6. The "Clubhouse Status" Hub

- **The Concept:** Nashville has key physical hubs (e.g., Club 12, 202
  Friendship House, etc.) that operate differently than church-basement
  meetings.
- **The Tool:** A live dashboard for the major buildings.
- **Key Features:**
  - **"Open Now?":** Simple indicator if the building doors are unlocked (vital
    for homeless or struggling users).
  - **"Next 3 Meetings":** A marquee showing the upcoming schedule for _that
    specific building_.
  - **"Vending/Coffee":** Icons indicating if they have food/caffeine available
    on site.

### 7. "The First 72 Hours" (Nashville Edition)

- **The Concept:** People move to Nashville specifically for recovery. The first
  3 days are chaotic.
- **The Tool:** A static, pre-loaded itinerary for a newcomer.
- **Key Features:**
  - **The Script:** "Day 1: Go to this assessment center (if needed). Go to this
    meeting (it's safe). Eat here (it's cheap)."
  - **The Transit Map:** A simplified overlay of the bus lines that hit the
    major recovery centers.
  - **"Where to wait":** Safe public places to sit while waiting for a bed or an
    appointment.

### 8. "Sober-Friendly Events" Feed (Non-Service)

- **The Concept:** "What do I do for fun?" (Distinct from service work).
- **The Tool:** A curated list of _social_ events where alcohol is not the
  center.
- **Key Features:**
  - **Curated Feed:** Sober comedy nights, "Sober Saturday" jams, run clubs, or
    coffee meetups.
  - **"Solo-Friendly" Tag:** Events where it’s socially acceptable to show up
    alone.
  - **Filter:** "Free" vs "Ticketed."
