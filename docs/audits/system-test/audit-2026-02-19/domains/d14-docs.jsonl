However, no dedicated CANON-*.md files exist in a standard location. The templates reference a pattern (CANON-NNNN numbered entries) that maps to Firestore validation schemas rather than standalone markdown docs. This dual interpretation could confuse new contributors.","recommendation":"Add a brief note in CANON_QUICK_REFERENCE.md clarifying that CANON entries are JSONL audit outputs, not standalone markdown files.","file":"docs/templates/CANON_QUICK_REFERENCE.md","line":1,"evidence":"docs/templates/CANONICAL_DOC_TEMPLATE.md exists (469 lines) — template for canonical documents\ndocs/templates/CANON_QUICK_REFERENCE.md exists (171 lines) — references CANON-NNNN pattern\ndocs/audits/multi-ai/maa-2026-02-17-182d43/canon/ — contains JSONL CANON files\nNo standalone CANON-*.md files exist in docs/reviews/CANON/ or similar","suggested_fix":"Informational. Either: (A) Create a docs/reviews/CANON/ directory with canonical markdown docs as referenced in templates, or (B) Update CANON_QUICK_REFERENCE.md to clarify the JSONL output model is the canonical approach.","status":"accepted","suggestion_text":"Accept at S3. Minor documentation clarity issue. The CANON system works but the naming/location could be clearer for new contributors.","counter_argument":"The CANON system is well-documented in templates. Contributors following the templates will find the right approach. The dual naming (CANON-*.md vs CANON-*.jsonl) reflects evolution of the system.","related_findings":[],"detected_at":"2026-02-19T14:55:00Z","reviewed_at":"2026-02-19T14:58:00Z"}
