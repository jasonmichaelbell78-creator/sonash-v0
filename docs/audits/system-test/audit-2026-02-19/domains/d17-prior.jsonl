Key open S0 items include: App Check disabled in production (DEBT-0853), CI security vulnerability with pull_request_target (DEBT-1878), 57 AI Instructions sections adding ~4,500 unnecessary lines (DEBT-2381), and multiple cognitive complexity violations in admin.ts and component files.","recommendation":"Prioritize S0 triage: resolve or re-classify the 19 open S0 items.

The 19 open S0 items represent known critical issues from prior audits. While tracked, their continued open status indicates a resolution velocity problem.","counter_argument":"All S0 items are tracked in TDMS and visible via /alerts. The 11% resolution rate reflects that most items were recently imported from audit aggregation.
