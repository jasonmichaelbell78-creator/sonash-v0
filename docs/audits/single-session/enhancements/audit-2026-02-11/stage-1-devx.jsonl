Total time 3-5s per commit","proposed_outcome":"Run independent checks in parallel (ESLint + pattern compliance + skill validation can all run concurrently), reducing total time to 2-3s","counter_argument":"Sequential execution provides clear error messages in order of importance. Parallel execution would interleave output and make failures harder to diagnose. The 1-2s savings may not justify the complexity","why_it_matters":"With 361 commits in 2 weeks, even 1-2s savings per commit adds up to 6-12 minutes of developer time saved","evidence":"Pre-commit hook is 279 lines with 13 sequential validation gates"}

Keep only cosmetic/advisory checks as non-blocking","counter_argument":"Non-blocking checks were set that way intentionally to avoid blocking PRs on non-critical issues during rapid development. Tightening could slow PR velocity","why_it_matters":"Non-blocking checks that always pass provide false confidence. If they fail silently, issues accumulate undetected","evidence":"5 checks with continue-on-error: true in ci.yml"}
