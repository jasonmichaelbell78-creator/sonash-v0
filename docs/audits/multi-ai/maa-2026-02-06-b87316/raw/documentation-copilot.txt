Repository: jasonmichaelbell78-creator/sonash-v0
EXECUTION_MODE: SEQUENTIAL
CAPABILITIES: browse_files=yes, run_commands=no, repo_checkout=no, limitations="I can browse files and search code via GitHub API but cannot run shell commands (npm scripts, grep, find, git log), so evidence is based on static file inspection and code search."

13 confirmed documentation findings + 3 off-category refactoring findings (excluded).
Key issues: S0 App Check doc contradicts disabled code, oversized docs (SESSION_CONTEXT 71KB, ROADMAP 155KB, AI_REVIEW_LEARNINGS_LOG 313KB),
75+ orphaned documents, filename with spaces, phantom src/dataconnect-generated references.
