SoNash v0
Code Quality Audit Report

February 2026


196 source files audited
3 Critical  |  4 High  |  8 Medium  |  2 Low
17 findings across security, architecture, testing & code quality



Stack: Next.js 16.1.1 | React 19.2.3 | TypeScript 5.x | Firebase 12.6.0 | Tailwind CSS 4.1.9


Executive Summary
This audit covers 196 TypeScript/TSX source files in the SoNash v0 recovery companion app. The codebase demonstrates strong fundamentals: excellent TypeScript discipline (only 1 'any' type), well-structured Firestore security rules, Zod validation on Cloud Functions, and a documented architecture. However, several critical security gaps and architectural inconsistencies require immediate attention.

Severity Definitions
Level    Label    Definition
S0    Critical    Security vulnerability, data loss risk, or completely broken functionality
S1    High    Significant maintainability or reliability risk; should fix before next major release
S2    Medium    Code quality issue, duplication, or inconsistency; address in normal development cycle
S3    Low    Minor improvement; address opportunistically
