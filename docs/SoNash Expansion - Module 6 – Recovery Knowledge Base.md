for the SoNash app, translating recovery culture into plain English to help
users navigate social and structural aspects of getting sober.

## Version History

| ------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| 1.0     | 2026-01-27 | Initial documentation |

---

**Core Philosophy:** "The Pocket Guide to the Unwritten Rules." We don't
reproduce the Big Book (copyright trap). We translate the _culture_ of recovery
into plain English, helping users navigate the social and structural confusion
of getting sober.

---

## Part 1: Expansions of Existing Ideas

### 1. "The Plain English Steps" (The Primer 2.0)

- **The Concept:** Official literature uses 1930s language ("defects,"
  "shortcomings," "ready to have God remove"). Newcomers often bounce off the
  religious/archaic tone.
- **The Tool:** A "Translator" Toggle.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **The Interaction:** Shows the traditional Step number. User toggles between
    **"Classic"** (if copyright allows/summarized) and **"Plain English"**.
  - **Example:**
    - _Step 3 (Classic):_ "Made a decision to turn our will..."
    - _Step 3 (Plain English):_ "I realized I am a terrible manager of my own
      life, so I fired myself and hired a new manager (Higher
      Power/Group/Universe)."
  - **Why:** It focuses on the _mechanism_ of the step, not the dogma.

### 2. "Am I Doing This Right?" (Etiquette Flowchart)

- **The Concept:** You have a guide, but static text is hard to find in a panic.
  Users worry about specific scenarios _in the moment_.
- **The Tool:** A situational flowchart/wizard.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **The "Panic" Scenarios:** User taps specific buttons:
    - _"I'm late—can I go in?"_ -> App: "Yes. Walk in quietly. Sit in the back.
      No one is judging you."
    - _"I'm crying—is that okay?"_ -> App: "Yes. That's why we're here. You
      don't have to stop."
    - _"They asked me to speak and I don't want to."_ -> App: "It's okay to say
      'I'm just listening today, thanks.'"
  - **Why:** Turns "Etiquette" into real-time anxiety reduction.

### 3. The "Smart" Glossary (Contextual Wiki)

- **The Concept:** A dictionary is passive. A user doesn't know what they don't
  know.
- **The Tool:** Active text highlighting (Hyper-text).
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **Integration:** When a user reads a "Primer" or "Guide" in the app,
    keywords like **"Qualifier," "Crosstalk,"** or **"Pink Cloud"** are
    underlined.
  - **The Action:** Tapping the word opens a small "tooltip" card definition
    without leaving the page.
  - **The "Slang" Filter:** Adds a section for Nashville/Southern specific
    recovery slang (if applicable) or fellowship-specific slang (e.g., "Double
    Winner").

### 4. "The Script Lab" (Sponsor Asking)

- **The Concept:** Knowing _how_ to ask is different from having the courage to
  speak the words.
- **The Tool:** Roleplay scripts with "Vibe" options.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **Choose your Vibe:**
    - _Direct:_ "Hey, I'm looking for a sponsor and I like what you shared. Are
      you available?"
    - _Casual:_ "I'm new to this and looking for guidance. Could we grab
      coffee?"
    - _Temporary:_ "I'm not ready for a permanent sponsor, but would you be my
      temporary sponsor for 30 days?"
  - **The "Rejection" Prep:** A sidebar guide: _"What if they say no?"_
    (Explaining that it's usually about _their_ bandwidth, not the user's
    worth).

### 5. Crisis Decision Tree (The Red Button)

- **The Concept:** In a crisis, people can't read paragraphs. They need binary
  choices.
- **The Tool:** A yes/no wizard.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **Q1:** "Are you in immediate physical danger?" (Yes -> Call 911 / No ->
    Next).
  - **Q2:** "Have you already used?" (Yes -> Detox Info / No -> Next).
  - **Q3:** "Do you feel like you are _about_ to use?" (Yes -> Call Sponsor /
    Find Meeting / Play Tape Forward).
  - **Why:** It filters the user to the exact resource they need (Medical vs.
    Social vs. Mental) within 10 seconds.

### 6. The Daily Principle Deck

- **The Concept:** Principles are abstract. Users need to know how to _apply_
  them.
- **The Tool:** A randomized card deck UI.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **The Draw:** User draws a card: **"Patience."**
  - **The Application:** _"How can you practice Patience in traffic today?"_ or
    _"How can you practice Patience with your family tonight?"_
  - **The Connection:** Links the principle back to the relevant Step (e.g.,
    Patience -> Step 6/7).

## Part 2: New Ideas (Knowledge Base)

### 7. "Anatomy of a Meeting" (Visual Map)

- **The Concept:** Social anxiety is a barrier. Newcomers are terrified of
  walking into a strange room.
- **The Tool:** An illustrated diagram of a "Typical" 12-step room.
- **Feature:**
  - **Visual:** A simple map showing: The Chair (Leader), The Coffee Pot, The
    Circle/Rows, The Basket.
  - **The "X" Marks the Spot:** Highlights "Safe seats for newcomers" (usually
    near the door if you need to escape, or in the back).
  - **The Rituals:** Explains "Why are they holding hands at the end?" or "Why
    are they throwing money in a basket?"

### 8. The "Normie" Translator (Family Guide)

- **The Concept:** Users often have to explain recovery to confused spouses or
  parents ("Normies").
- **The Tool:** Shareable cards/articles written _for_ the family member.
- **Feature:**
  - **Topics:** _"Why can't I go to the meeting with you?"_, _"What is a sponsor
    (and are they your lover?)",_ _"Why are you so tired?"_
  - **Action:** User can hit "Share" to text a clean, non-confrontational
    explanation to their partner.

### 9. The "Service Menu" (Micro-Service)

- **The Concept:** Service is key to sobriety, but newcomers think it means
  "becoming the president."
- **The Tool:** A "Menu" of service options ranked by difficulty.
- **Feature:**
  - **Appetizers (Low Stakes):** "Arrive 5 mins early," "Put away one chair,"
    "Smile at a newcomer."
  - **Entrees (Commitment):** "Make the coffee," "Greeter at the door," "Read
    the opening format."
  - **Desserts (Leadership):** "Treasurer," "Secretary" (Unlocked later).

### 10. "The Fellowship Compass" (Which Program?)

- **The Concept:** Nashville has AA, NA, CA, CMA, SMART, Dharma, etc. Newcomers
  don't know the difference.
- **The Tool:** A comparison guide.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Breakdown:**
    - _AA:_ "Focus on Alcohol (but inclusive). The original."
    - _NA:_ "Focus on Addiction (all substances). Focus on the disease."
    - _CA:_ "Focus on Solution (all substances). Big Book based." (Highlighting
      your fellowship).
    - _SMART:_ "CBT-based, non-spiritual, practical tools."
  - **The "Vibe":** Describes the typical "feel" of each (e.g., NA is often
    younger/rowdier; AA is often structured).

### 11. "The Traditions" in Real Life

- **The Concept:** The 12 Traditions are usually ignored by newcomers, but they
  are actually relationship hacks.
- **The Tool:** Applying traditions to relationships/work.
- **Feature:**
  - **Tradition 1 (Unity):** "Is being 'right' worth blowing up the
    relationship?"
  - **Tradition 2 (Group Conscience):** "Am I acting like a dictator in my
    family, or am I listening?"
  - **Tradition 12 (Anonymity/Principles):** "Am I judging the person or
    listening to their message?"

### 12. The "Readiness" Checkers (Quizzes)

- **The Concept:** Users often ask, "Am I ready to date?" or "Am I ready to make
  amends?"
- **The Tool:** Self-reflective quizzes (NOT pass/fail, just reflective).
- **Feature:**
  - **Dating Readiness:** _"Are you comfortable being alone?"_, _"Are you
    looking for a distraction?"_
  - **Amends Readiness:** _"Are you still angry?"_, _"Do you secretly want them
    to apologize to you?"_
  - **Output:** A gentle suggestion: _"You might want to wait a bit longer,"_ or
    _"Discuss this with your sponsor."_
