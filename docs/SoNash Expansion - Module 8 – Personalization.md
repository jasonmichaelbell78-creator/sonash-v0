# SoNash Expansion: Module 8 – Personalization

## Purpose

Expansion module ideation document exploring personalization features for the
SoNash app, allowing users to customize the interface, terminology, and features
to match their specific recovery program and preferences.

## Version History

| Version | Date       | Description           |
| ------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| 1.0     | 2026-01-27 | Initial documentation |

---

**Core Philosophy:** "The App Fits You, You Don't Fit the App." We avoid the
"one size fits all" trap of standard 12-step apps. Whether a user is an atheist
in AA, a religious member of CA, or using SMART Recovery, the app's interface
should reflect _their_ language and _their_ reality.

---

## Part 1: Expansions of Existing Ideas

### 1. "The Rosetta Stone" (Program & Terminology Toggle)

- **The Concept:** A user in NA feels alienated seeing "Sobriety Date" (they use
  "Clean Date"). A user in CA (Cocaine Anonymous) needs "Cocaine/All Mind
  Altering Substances" language.
- **The Tool:** A global vocabulary switcher.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **The Presets:**
    - _Generic (Default):_ Uses "Recovery," "Sober," "Substance."
    - _AA Style:_ Uses "Sobriety," "Alcohol," "Fellowship."
    - _NA Style:_ Uses "Clean Time," "Addiction," "Recovery."
    - _Secular/SMART:_ Uses "Abstinence," "Behavior," "Choice."
  - **The Effect:** Instantly updates labels on the Dashboard, Tracker, and
    Profile without changing the underlying code logic.

### 2. "The Journey Phase" (Stage Selector)

- **The Concept:** A newcomer needs a panic button and a meeting finder. An
  old-timer with 10 years needs a sponsee list and a service tracker. Showing
  everything to everyone creates clutter.
- **The Tool:** A UI adaptability engine.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **Newcomer Mode (Day 0–90):** Home screen prioritizes **"Days Sober," "Find
    a Meeting,"** and **"Urge Surfing."** Step Work is simplified to Steps 1–3.
  - **Action Mode (The Work):** Home screen prioritizes **"Step Work"**
    (specifically Step 4/8/9) and **"Journal."**
  - **Maintenance Mode (Living It):** Home screen prioritizes **"Nightly Review
    (Step 10)," "Service Tracker,"** and **"Gratitude."**

### 3. "The Dashboard Builder" (Widget Chooser)

- **The Concept:** Users have different motivations. Some are motivated by the
  "Day Count" (Pride), others by the "Journal" (Reflection).
- **The Tool:** A drag-and-drop home screen editor.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **The Blocks:** Users can toggle on/off: _Day Counter, Weekly Graph, Quick
    Journal, Daily Quote, Random Photo (The Anchor), Service Log._
  - **Hierarchy:** Users can pin their most important tool to the top. (e.g.,
    Someone struggling with cravings pins "Urge Log" to the top).

### 4. "The Nudge Engine" (Notification Architect)

- **The Concept:** "One size fits all" notifications get turned off. Some users
  need accountability (loud); others need discretion (quiet).
- **The Tool:** Granular alert controls.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **Timing:** "Send my Daily Review prompt at [9:00 PM]."
  - **Stealth:** Toggle "Private Text" (Notification says _"Time to check in"_
    vs. _"Did you stay sober today?"_).
  - **Frequency:**
    - _High (Crisis):_ 3x daily check-ins.
    - _Medium (Standard):_ 1x daily review.
    - _Low (Maintenance):_ Weekly summary only.

## Part 2: New Ideas (Personalization)

### 5. "Name Your Power" (Spiritual Customization)

- **The Concept:** The biggest barrier to 12-step entry is the word "God." Even
  "Higher Power" feels religious to some.
- **The Tool:** A global "Find and Replace" for spiritual terms.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Prompt:** "How do you refer to the power greater than yourself?"
  - **The Options:** _God, Higher Power, The Universe, The Group, Love, G.O.D.
    (Good Orderly Direction), Nature._
  - **The Magic:** The app dynamically replaces this term in _all_ Step
    Worksheets. (e.g., Step 3 becomes: _"Made a decision to turn my will over to
    the care of **The Group** as I understood it."_)

### 6. "The Focus" (Substance vs. Behavior)

- **The Concept:** Recovery isn't just about drugs/alcohol anymore. It's
  gambling, food, sex, tech. The "Day Counter" needs to reflect the specific
  struggle.
- **The Tool:** Tracker logic adapter.
- **Feature:**
  - **Input:** "What are you recovering from?"
  - **Adaptation:**
    - _Substance:_ Tracks "Complete Abstinence" (Standard).
    - _Process (e.g., Spending/Food):_ Tracks "Abstinent Days" vs. "Slips"
      (nuanced tracking).
  - **Visuals:** Updates icons (e.g., Wine glass -> Dice -> Phone).

### 7. "Notebook Aesthetics" (The Vibe)

- **The Concept:** Reinforcing the "Notebook" metaphor. If it feels like a
  sterile app, it feels clinical. If it feels like _my_ book, it feels safe.
- **The Tool:** Visual theming engine.
- **Feature:**
  - **Paper Type:** Users choose the background of their text inputs: _Lined
    Paper (Classic), Dot Grid (Bullet Journal), Blank (Clean), Dark Mode
    (OLED)._
  - **Font Style:** _Handwritten (Personal feel)_ vs. _Sans-Serif
    (Readability)._
  - **Cover Art:** Users choose the "skin" of the app header (Leather,
    Composition Book, Abstract Art).

### 8. "The 'Why' Anchor" (Visual Motivation)

- **The Concept:** In a moment of craving, abstract concepts fail. Users need a
  concrete reminder of _why_ they are doing this.
- **The Tool:** A persistent visual header.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Upload:** User uploads a photo (Kids, Spouse, "Before" picture, Dream
    House).
  - **The Placement:** This image lives at the very top of the Dashboard or the
    "Urge Surfing" screen.
  - **The Text:** Optional caption: _"Do it for them"_ or _"Never go back."_

### 9. "Accessibility Plus" (Readability)

- **The Concept:** Many people in recovery are older or have vision issues.
  Standard system settings aren't always enough.
- **The Tool:** Enhanced UI scaling.
- **Feature:**
  - **"Reading Glasses" Mode:** One-tap toggle to bump all worksheet text size
    by 150%.
  - **High Contrast:** For low-light readability (e.g., writing inventory at
    night).
  - **Dyslexia Font:** Option to swap to OpenDyslexic font for easier reading.

### 10. "The 'Red Line' List" (Trigger Filter)

- **The Concept:** Some users are triggered by seeing specific words (e.g.,
  specific drug names) or specific metrics (weight/calories).
- **The Tool:** Content masking.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Setting:** "Hide references to..."
  - **The Application:** If the app pulls in community shares or standard
    prompts, it masks/blurs keywords selected by the user.

### 11. "Sponsor Link Status" (Relationship Toggle)

- **The Concept:** Not everyone has a sponsor _yet_, and the app nagging them to
  "Share with Sponsor" can be annoying.
- **The Tool:** Feature visibility toggle.
- **Feature:**
  - **State:** "I have a Sponsor" [Yes/No].
  - **If Yes:** Show "Export to Sponsor" buttons and "Call Sponsor" FAB.
  - **If No:** Hide those buttons. Replace with a subtle "Guide: How to find a
    sponsor" in the Knowledge Base.
