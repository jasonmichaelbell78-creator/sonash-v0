## 📊 STATUS LEGEND

### Status Values
- **PENDING**: Not started; prerequisites may or may not be complete
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Currently being worked on
- **COMPLETE**: All acceptance criteria met and verified
- **BLOCKED**: Cannot proceed due to dependencies or external factors
- **DEFERRED**: Intentionally postponed to later work
- **DEPRECATED**: No longer relevant or superseded by newer work

### Priority Values
- **P0**: Critical - Must be done immediately
- **P1**: High - Should be done soon
- **P2**: Medium - Should be done eventually
- **P3**: Low - Nice to have

### Risk Values
- **HIGH**: Significant risk to project success, timeline, or quality
- **MEDIUM**: Moderate risk with manageable impact
- **LOW**: Minimal risk with low impact

**📌 Note on Status Dimensions:**
- **Status**, **Priority**, and **Risk** are independent fields
- A COMPLETE item can still have HIGH risk if mitigation is pending
- BLOCKED items don't automatically become P0 unless escalation is required
- For DEPRECATED items, progress is typically locked at final % or marked N/A

**END OF TEMPLATE**

**Usage Notes:**
- Replace all [bracketed placeholders] with actual content
- Remove sections not applicable to your specific document
- Add sections as needed for your use case
- Maintain consistent formatting and structure
- Update status indicators regularly

**When to Use Simplified Version:**

This full template is comprehensive (16+ sections) and best for large initiatives. **Use a lighter version** for:
- Small features, quick wins, or bug fixes
- Experiments or proof-of-concepts
- Single-task work items

**Sections to omit for lightweight docs:**
- Gap Analysis (skip detailed analysis)
- Detailed Work Items (keep task list minimal)
- Extensive Acceptance Criteria (keep 3-5 items max)
- Reasoning & Decisions (include only if critical)

**Simplified template = Core sections only:** Purpose, Status Dashboard, one Item/Phase section (with What Was Accomplished), AI Instructions
