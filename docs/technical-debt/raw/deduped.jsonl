While the comment states this provides '~281 trillion combinations', this level of collision resistance may be insufficient for privacy guarantees. With a user base of N users, the birthday paradox means collisions become likely around sqrt(2^48) = ~16.7 million users. More importantly, because Firebase UIDs have a known format (28 alphanumeric characters), and the hash has no salt, an attacker with access to security logs could build a rainbow table by hashing all possible Firebase UIDs to find the original UID from a 12-character hash. Without a salt, the hash is deterministic and reversible for known-format inputs.","recommendation":"Add a secret salt to the hashUserId function that is stored in GCP Secret Manager (not in source code).
