# SoNash Expansion: Module 9 – Daily Engagement & Habits

## Purpose

Expansion module ideation document exploring daily engagement and habit-building
features for the SoNash app, designed as low-friction, high-impact
micro-interactions that build recovery muscle.

## Version History

| Version | Date       | Description           |

**Core Philosophy:** "The Next Right Thing." We don't want the user glued to the
phone. We want them to get in, get grounded, and get out into their life. These
tools are designed to be "low friction, high impact" micro-interactions that
build the muscle of recovery without the grind.

## Part 1: Expansions of Existing Ideas

### 1. "The One Action" (Dynamic Home Screen)

- **The Concept:** When an addict wakes up, their brain is often a chaotic
  committee. A dashboard with 10 buttons (Journal, Meeting, Step Work) is
  overwhelming. They need _one_ clear instruction.
- **The Tool:** A contextual suggestion engine.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **Morning Logic:** If it's 7 AM and they haven't checked in, the _only_
    major button is **"Set Intention."**
  - **Mid-Day Logic:** If they flagged "Anxiety" earlier, the button morphs to
    **"Breathe (1 min)."**
  - **Evening Logic:** If it's 9 PM, the button becomes **"Review Day."**
  - **The "Shuffle" Option:** If they don't like the suggestion, they can swipe
    it away to see the next best action (e.g., "Read a Page," "Call a Friend").

### 2. "The Bookends" (AM/PM Routine)

- **The Concept:** Recovery is held in place by how you start and end the day.
  Everything in the middle can be chaos, but the bookends must be solid.
- **The Tool:** A paired check-in system.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **The AM Launch:** Not just a mood log. It asks: _"What is your primary
    focus today?"_ (e.g., Patience, Service, Just Not Using). It saves this as a
    sticky notification on the phone.
  - **The PM Landing:** Closes the loop. _"How did you do with [Focus]?"_ +
    _"What is one thing you did well?"_
  - **The Streak:** Tracks "Bookends Completed" (consistency) rather than just
    "Days Sober" (abstinence).

### 3. "The Wave" (Urge Surfing Companion)

- **The Concept:** A craving feels like it will last forever. Science says it
  lasts ~20 minutes. The user needs a tool to "ride out" that time window
  without acting.
- **The Tool:** An interactive, timer-based visualizer.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **The Visual:** A literal wave animation that rises and falls over a
    20-minute timer.
  - **The Anchor:** Every 3 minutes, the screen changes prompts: _"Where do you
    feel it in your body?"_ -> _"Breathe into that spot"_ -> _"Watch the
    intensity drop."_
  - **The Log:** After the timer ends, it logs a "Victory." It adds to a stat:
    _"You have surfed 12 urges this week."_

### 4. "Compassionate Milestones" (The Anti-Streak)

- **The Concept:** Standard counters shame you when you reset. They erase
  history. We want to celebrate the _cumulative effort_, even if there was a
  slip.
- **The Tool:** A multi-dimensional progress tracker.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **"The Total" vs. "The Streak":** Displays _"You have been sober for 28 of
    the last 30 days"_ (93% Success Rate) alongside the current streak.
  - **Action Milestones:** Celebrates behavior, not just time. _"You hit 100
    Meetings!"_ or _"You completed Step 5!"_
  - **The Chip Jar:** A digital visual of a jar filling up with marbles (days),
    giving a sense of weight and accumulation that isn't lost if one marble
    falls out.

### 5. "The Share Pocket" (Meeting Prep)

- **The Concept:** Users have profound insights on Tuesday morning but forget
  them by the Thursday night meeting. They end up sharing generic fluff instead
  of their real truth.
- **The Tool:** A cross-app flagging system.
- **Expanded Feature:**
  - **The Flag:** A small "Hand Raise" icon on every journal entry, step
    worksheet, or daily review.
  - **The View:** When the user arrives at a meeting (detected by location or
    manual entry), the app offers **"Meeting Mode."**
  - **The Card:** It presents a simple list of all "Flagged" items from the
    week: _"Talk about the fight with Mom"_ or _"Share the victory about not
    drinking at the wedding."_

### 6. "The Pause" Protocol (Agitation Interrupter)

- **The Concept:** The most dangerous state in recovery is "Agitation." We need
  a physical button to break the train of thought.
- **The Tool:** A haptic-feedback grounding tool.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Trigger:** A big "PAUSE" button always available in the footer.
  - **The Action:** When tapped, the screen goes black. The phone vibrates in a
    slow, rhythmic "heartbeat" pattern for 10 seconds.
  - **The Prompt:** Only _after_ the vibrations stop does the text appear:
    _"What is the threat right now?"_
  - **Why:** It forces a physiological reset before a cognitive one.

### 7. "Habit Stacker" (Routine Builder)

- **The Concept:** New habits fail. Stacking them onto old habits works. (e.g.,
  "After I brush my teeth, I will pray.")
- **The Tool:** A logical recipe builder.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Anchor:** User selects an existing habit (Coffee, Commute, Shower,
    Lunch, Bedtime).
  - **The Stack:** User attaches a recovery action (Read Daily Reflection, Call
    Sponsor, Listen to Speaker).
  - **The Reminder:** The notification is specific: _"You're having coffee...
    time to read your reflection."_

### 8. "Service Snaps" (Micro-Service Logger)

- **The Concept:** Low self-esteem is the killer. Doing esteemable acts is the
  cure. We gamify "being a good person."
- **The Tool:** A quick-log interface for tiny acts of kindness.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Menu:** One-tap icons for: _Held a Door, Called a Relative, Texted a
    Newcomer, Picked up Trash, Let Someone Merge in Traffic._
  - **The Recap:** "You did 5 secret good deeds today."
  - **Why:** It retrains the brain to look for opportunities to be useful,
    shifting focus from "Self" to "Others."

### 9. "The 'Nashville Sound' Mood Shifter" (Music Therapy)

- **The Concept:** Music is a massive part of Nashville culture and a powerful
  mood regulator. Early sobriety can feel quiet and lonely; the right playlist
  changes the room.
- **The Tool:** A deep-link integrator for Spotify/Apple Music.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Selector:** "I need to feel..." [Calm] [Hyped] [Connected]
    [Understood].
  - **The Action:** Tapping [Calm] instantly deep-links to a user-defined
    playlist or a curated "Sober Chill" mix.
  - **The "Speaker Tape" Mode:** One tap to start a curated AA/NA speaker tape
    (audio only) for when music isn't enough.

### 10. "Sleep Hygiene" Prep (The Wind-Down)

- **The Concept:** Insomnia is a massive relapse trigger in the first 90 days.
  The "Nightly Review" is good, but users need help physically winding down.
- **The Tool:** A pre-sleep wizard.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Screen:** Turns automatically to "Red Light" mode (dark warm colors).
  - **The Brain Dump:** A text box explicitly for _"Things I'm worried about for
    tomorrow."_
  - **The Vault:** When they hit "Save," an animation shows these worries being
    locked away in a safe. _"They are safe here. You don't need to hold them
    while you sleep."_

### 11. "The 'Drive Time' Companion" (Commute Mode)

- **The Concept:** Nashville is a driving city. Traffic is a major trigger for
  anger (road rage) and isolation. The car is where many addicts used to use. We
  need to reclaim that space.
- **The Tool:** A hands-free, high-contrast "Car Mode."
- **Feature:**
  - **Big Buttons:** Oversized interface for safe tapping while docked.
  - **Voice Journal:** "Talk to the App" mode to rant about traffic or practice
    a share without looking at the screen.
  - **"Traffic Prayer":** A quick audio clip (30 seconds) that plays a grounding
    prayer or breathing exercise designed specifically for when you are stuck on
    I-24 or I-65.
