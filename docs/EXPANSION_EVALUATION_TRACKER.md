# Expansion Evaluation Tracker

**Document Version:** 2.1 **Created:** 2026-01-20 | **Last Updated:** 2026-01-22

---

## Purpose

This document tracks the systematic evaluation of ~280 expansion ideas across 21
modules (12 feature + 9 technical) for the SoNash project. It maintains:

- **Progress status** for all modules (F1-F12, T1-T9)
- **Staging area** for accepted/deferred items before ROADMAP push
- **Decision log** with rationale for each evaluated idea
- **Placement metadata** (milestone, insertion point, relationship) for ROADMAP
  integration
- **Quick Resume** context for multi-session evaluation workflow

This is the **source of truth** for expansion evaluation state, used by the
`/expansion-evaluation` skill.

---

## AI Instructions

When working with this tracker:

1. **Always read this file first** before any expansion evaluation actions
2. **Check Quick Resume** to understand current context and next suggested
   module
3. **Update incrementally** during evaluation sessions (don't batch at end)
4. **Discuss placement** for ALL accepted/deferred items (milestone, feature
   group, insertion point)
5. **Stage items, don't push** - Only user can request
   `/expansion-evaluation push-to-roadmap`
6. **Record full rationale** in decision logs for future reference
7. **Update Quick Resume** at session end with clear context for next session

**Critical:** Placement metadata (Placement, Insert After, Relationship) is
**mandatory** for all accepted AND deferred items.

---

## Quick Start

**For new evaluation sessions:**

1. Run `/expansion-evaluation begin` to load current state and get context
2. Review "Quick Resume" section below for last session context
3. Check "Staged for ROADMAP" count - remind user if >10 items awaiting push
4. Continue from suggested next module or user can specify any module

**For resuming work:**

1. Check "Last Session" date in Quick Resume
2. Review any open questions or decisions made since last session
3. Use `/expansion-evaluation evaluate [module]` to jump to specific module

## Command Reference

| Command                                       | Description                        |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `/expansion-evaluation begin`                 | Initialize or resume evaluation    |
| `/expansion-evaluation evaluate [module]`     | Jump to a specific module          |
| `/expansion-evaluation evaluate [module] [n]` | Jump to specific idea in module    |
| `/expansion-evaluation status`                | Show progress and recent decisions |
| `/expansion-evaluation decide [action]`       | Record decision for current idea   |
| `/expansion-evaluation questions`             | Review open questions              |
| `/expansion-evaluation end`                   | Save checkpoint and commit         |
| `/expansion-evaluation push-to-roadmap`       | Push staged decisions to ROADMAP   |

### Decision Actions

- `accept [milestone] [reason]` - Stage for ROADMAP (not pushed until requested)
- `defer [reason]` - Good idea, not now
- `reject [reason]` - Doesn't fit
- `merge [item] [reason]` - Enhance existing ROADMAP item
- `discuss` - Mark for more discussion

### ROADMAP Integration Process

**Important:** Decisions are STAGED, not immediately pushed to ROADMAP.md.

1. During evaluation, accepted ideas are logged in "Staged for ROADMAP" section
2. User reviews staged items with `/expansion-evaluation status`
3. User explicitly requests `/expansion-evaluation push-to-roadmap` when ready
4. Only then are items added to ROADMAP.md and committed

This prevents ROADMAP churn and allows batch review before integration.

---

## Final Step: ROADMAP Review & Reorganization

**🎯 ACTION REQUIRED AFTER ALL MODULES EVALUATED**

Once all 21 modules (F1-F12, T1-T9) are complete, do NOT immediately implement.
Instead, schedule a dedicated session for:

### ROADMAP Review, Refinement & Reorganization

**Purpose:**

- Review all ~280 evaluated ideas holistically
- Identify cross-module dependencies and clusters
- Reorganize milestones for logical implementation order
- Refine feature groupings and milestone boundaries
- Validate architectural coherence across accepted features
- Create final implementation plan with sequencing rationale

**Deliverables:**

1. Refined ROADMAP.md with optimized milestone structure
2. Cross-module dependency map
3. Implementation sequencing strategy
4. Risk mitigation plan for complex integrations
5. Updated effort estimates based on clustered work

**When to Schedule:**

- After T9 evaluation complete (last module)
- Before starting any M5+ implementation
- Estimated time: 2-3 hours dedicated session

**Note:** This session will create a new section in
EXPANSION_EVALUATION_TRACKER.md documenting the reorganization plan and
rationale.

## Foundational Decisions

All 12 foundational questions have been answered. These decisions guide all
module evaluations.

### Architecture Decisions

| Q#  | Question               | Decision                        | Rationale                                                                                 |
| --- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Offline-first priority | **Per-feature decision**        | Evaluate each module's offline need individually rather than blanket policy               |
| 3   | Encryption scope       | **Mandatory maximum**           | All step work encrypted as much as possible; implementation details TBD during T4         |
| 10  | Native wrapper         | **Defer**                       | Focus on PWA first; revisit when evaluating F11/T8                                        |
| 11  | Evaluation order       | **Hybrid (dependency-grouped)** | Analyze F↔T connections; group related items; slot standalone technical into feature flow |

### Feature Decisions

| Q#  | Question        | Decision                        | Rationale                                                                               |
| --- | --------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4   | Nashville scope | **Nashville-first, abstracted** | Build for Nashville but with city as parameter for future expansion                     |
| 5   | Sponsor model   | **Push only**                   | Sponsee sends read-only snapshots on demand; maximum privacy and user agency            |
| 6   | Meeting finder  | **Explore automation**          | Already built manually; worth exploring scripts for periodic pulls + geocoding pipeline |

### Technical Decisions

| Q#  | Question          | Decision                                    | Rationale                                                                                         |
| --- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7   | IndexedDB library | **Dexie.js**                                | Rich query API, React `useLiveQuery` hook, declarative schema, encryption addon support           |
| 8   | PDF generation    | **@react-pdf/renderer**                     | React component model, flexbox layout, automatic pagination; bundle size acceptable (lazy-loaded) |
| 9   | Analytics         | **Minimal custom (Tier 1 + opt-in Tier 2)** | Privacy-first; Tier 1 = anonymous aggregates, Tier 2 = explicit opt-in for richer data            |

### Process Decisions

| Q#  | Question            | Decision                      | Rationale                                                             |
| --- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 12  | ROADMAP integration | **Staged with explicit push** | Log decisions during evaluation; push to ROADMAP only on user request |

document (T1.18 ADR)

**T1.6 + T1.15 Implementation Notes (Storage Management):**

- **T1.6 (Persistent Storage):** Request after first journal entry with clear
  warning
- **T1.15 (Quota Management):** Monitor usage, warn at 80%/90%/95%, cleanup
  tools
- **Combined "Storage Management" cluster in T1.12 Settings Panel**
- Persistent storage permission + quota monitoring + usage display
- If permission denied: Offer "Online-Only Mode" (Firestore only, no local)
- iOS-specific: Handle 50MB hard limit (T1.14)
- Smart cleanup: Delete oldest synced entries, export-before-delete

**T1.11 Implementation Notes (Unified Sync Status):**

- Combined T1.7 (staleness) + T1.11 (queue depth) into single feature
- Header badge: "Last synced 2h ago • 3 pending uploads"
- Color coding: 🟢 synced, 🟡 stale, 🔴 errors
- Smart visibility: auto-hide when all synced (reduces noise)
- Tap to expand for detailed sync stats in settings
- Priority: Medium (ship after core sync T1.2-T1.4 works)

**T1.12 Implementation Notes (Settings Panel):**

- All 5 AIs unanimous - marked "high priority"
- Full settings: offline toggle, manual sync, storage management
- Natural integration point for T1.6 (persistent storage), T1.11 (sync status),
  T1.15 (quota)
- MVP controls: offline mode toggle, manual sync button, storage usage display
- Advanced: view sync queue, clear cache, detailed stats
- Start simple and expand over time

**T1.18 Documentation Task (ADR):**

- Create Architecture Decision Record:
  `docs/architecture/ADR-001-offline-sync-approach.md`
- Document decision, context, alternatives (PouchDB/RxDB), rationale
- Explain why custom sync (T1.2-T1.4) + Dexie.js (T1.1) over off-the-shelf
  solutions
- Prevents future revisiting of already-decided architectural questions
- Standard ADR format, ~30 minutes to write
