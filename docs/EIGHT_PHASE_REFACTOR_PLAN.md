## 🎯 DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This is the **CANONICAL** tracking document for the 8-phase security and architecture refactoring project. This document serves as:

1. **Single source of truth** for refactoring status across all phases
2. **Coordination mechanism** across multiple AI sessions, days, and weeks
3. **Gap analysis tracker** showing intended vs. actual work
4. **Dependency map** showing execution order constraints
5. **Historical record** of decisions and reasoning

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: This document must be updated after each work session. Do NOT proceed with implementation without consulting this document first.

Phase 3 (PR3) ──────> Phase 5 (PR5)
```

### Dependency Details

**Phase 1 (PR1)** blocks:
- Phase 2 (PR2) - Must establish canonical write surface before unifying access patterns
- Phase 4 (PR4) - Rate limiting alignment requires security surface to be stable
- Phase 8 (PR8) - Journal hook refactor depends on write surface being locked down

**Phase 2 (PR2)** blocks:
- Phase 5 (PR5) - Growth card refactor needs unified Firestore patterns
- Phase 6 (PR6) - CRUD factory needs Firestore access consolidated first
- Phase 7 (PR7) - Testing DB services requires services to be unified
- Phase 8 (PR8) - Journal model must be unified before auth state alignment

**Phase 3 (PR3)** blocks:
- Phase 5 (PR5) - Type guards needed for error handling in growth cards

**Phase 6 (PR6)** blocks:
- Phase 7 (PR7) - Tests for rotation logic need rotation helper to exist first

### Recommended Execution Order

1. **Start with PR1 + PR3** (parallel) - Independent security and typing foundations
2. **Then PR2** - Unify patterns (depends on PR1)
3. **Then PR4 + PR6** (parallel) - Both depend on PR2
4. **Then PR5** - Depends on PR2 and PR3
5. **Then PR7** - Depends on PR2 and PR6
6. **Finally PR8** - Depends on PR1 and PR2

**Critical Path**: PR1 → PR2 → PR7 (longest dependency chain)

## 🎯 MACRO-LEVEL SUMMARY

### Project Goals

This 8-phase refactoring plan addresses **cross-cutting duplication and inconsistency** across the SoNash Recovery Notebook codebase. The plan emerged from a comprehensive code audit that identified 44 canonical findings across security, architecture, typing, and testing domains.

### Problem Statement

The codebase exhibits several systemic issues:

1. **Security Fragmentation**: Multiple write surfaces (direct Firestore, service layer, Cloud Functions) create inconsistent enforcement of App Check, rate limiting, and validation
2. **Duplication Clusters**: Critical logic (journal writes, Firestore access, error handling, content rotation) duplicated across 3-5 locations
3. **Type Safety Gaps**: Runtime validation drift from TypeScript types; unsafe casts at boundaries
4. **Testing Gaps**: Critical paths (auth linking, Cloud Functions, write operations) lack coverage
5. **Architecture Drift**: Mixed patterns for same concerns (auth state, storage keys, callable wrappers)

### Success Criteria

Upon completion of all 8 phases:

- ✅ Single canonical write surface for journal/notebook entries (Cloud Functions)
- ✅ App Check enforced consistently across all protected operations
- ✅ Firestore access patterns unified (one service abstraction)
- ✅ Type safety improved (error guards, validation alignment, reduced casts)
- ✅ Rate limiting consistent across client and server
- ✅ Growth card logic consolidated into shared primitives
- ✅ Content rotation logic (quotes/slogans) deduplicated
- ✅ Test coverage >70% for critical paths
- ✅ Auth state derives from single provider (no duplicate listeners)

### Buckets (Categories)

Phases are organized into 6 buckets:

1. **security-hardening** (PR1, PR4) - App Check, rate limiting, validation
2. **firebase-access** (PR2) - Firestore patterns, journal models, admin init
3. **types-domain** (PR3) - Error guards, SSR safety, validation alignment
4. **ui-primitives** (PR5) - Growth cards, notifications, badges
5. **hooks-standardization** (PR6) - Rotation helpers, CRUD factories
6. **tests-hardening** (PR7) - Coverage for auth, DB services, callables
7. **boundaries** (PR8) - Auth provider, server/client split

## Intentions & Goals

### Primary Goal
Standardize notebook writes through Cloud Functions, ensure App Check enforcement, and review rules for journal entries.

### Specific Objectives
1. **Establish canonical write surface**: Make Cloud Function callable the single, authoritative write path for notebook/journal entries
2. **Re-enable App Check**: Restore App Check enforcement that was previously disabled or commented out
3. **Align security layers**: Ensure rate limiting, validation, and App Check work consistently across all write paths
4. **Review Firestore rules**: Verify rules match intended security policy (Cloud Functions-only vs. client writes)
5. **Document policy**: Clarify and document the intended write strategy for future maintainers

### Why This Phase Matters
This is the **highest priority security work** in the entire 8-phase plan. Multiple parallel write paths fragment security enforcement:
- Client-side rate limiting can be bypassed
- Client-side validation can be disabled via DevTools
- App Check enforcement is inconsistent or missing
- Firestore rules comments don't match actual enforcement

Without fixing this foundation, subsequent phases (PR2-PR8) will build on unstable security assumptions.

```

**Task Status**: ⚠️ **95% COMPLETE** (verified 2025-12-30)

**What's Done**:
- ✅ `hooks/use-journal.ts::addEntry` (line 247) calls Cloud Function `saveJournalEntry`
- ✅ `hooks/use-journal.ts::crumplePage` (line 306) calls Cloud Function `softDeleteJournalEntry`
- ✅ `lib/firestore-service.ts::saveDailyLog` (line 132) calls Cloud Function
- ✅ `lib/firestore-service.ts::saveInventoryEntry` (line 339) calls Cloud Function
- ✅ `lib/firestore-service.ts::saveNotebookJournalEntry` (line 412) calls Cloud Function

**What's NOT Done** (Remaining 5%):
- ❌ `lib/firestore-service.ts::saveJournalEntry` (line 366-394) - DEPRECATED method with direct Firestore write
- ❌ `components/notebook/journal-modal.tsx` (line 29) - uses deprecated `FirestoreService.saveJournalEntry`

**Remaining Implementation Steps**:
1. ~~Verify Cloud Function exists~~ ✅ DONE - `saveJournalEntry` exists in `functions/src/index.ts`
2. ~~Migrate main hook~~ ✅ DONE - `hooks/use-journal.ts::addEntry` already uses Cloud Function
3. **TODO**: Update `components/notebook/journal-modal.tsx` to use `useJournal` hook instead
4. **TODO**: Delete deprecated `lib/firestore-service.ts::saveJournalEntry` method
5. **TODO**: Add test coverage for journal write paths
6. **TODO**: Grep verification that no direct Firestore writes remain

}
```

**Task Status**: ❌ **0% COMPLETE - OPPOSITE ACTION TAKEN** (verified 2025-12-30)

**What's Currently Deployed** (OPPOSITE of goal):
- ❌ `functions/src/index.ts` line 78: `requireAppCheck: false` (saveDailyLog)
- ❌ `functions/src/index.ts` line 170: `requireAppCheck: false` (saveJournalEntry)
- ❌ `functions/src/index.ts` line 265: `requireAppCheck: false` (softDeleteJournalEntry)
- ❌ `functions/src/index.ts` line 363: `requireAppCheck: false` (saveInventoryEntry)
- ❌ `functions/src/index.ts` lines 492-497: App Check verification commented out (migrateAnonymousUserData)
- ❌ `lib/firebase.ts` lines 45-78: App Check initialization entirely commented out
- Comment states: "TEMPORARILY DISABLED - waiting for throttle to clear"

**Why It's Disabled**:
- Firebase App Check hit 403 throttle errors (24-hour limit)
- Workaround: Implemented manual reCAPTCHA Enterprise instead
- Made reCAPTCHA **optional** to support corporate networks that block Google services

**⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE**: This contradicts PR1's primary security goal

**Implementation Steps** (to complete this CANON):
1. **Decide Strategy**:
   - Option A: Re-enable App Check + keep optional reCAPTCHA (defense in depth)
   - Option B: Wait for throttle to clear, then re-enable App Check only
   - Option C: Accept weaker security posture (reCAPTCHA optional, no App Check)
2. **If re-enabling**: Change all `requireAppCheck: false` to `true`
3. **If re-enabling**: Uncomment App Check initialization in `lib/firebase.ts`
4. **If re-enabling**: Set up debug tokens for development
5. Test thoroughly before deploying

**Dependencies**: Decision on App Check strategy must be made first

}
```

**Task Status**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE** (verified 2025-12-30)

**What's Verified**:
- ✅ `firestore.rules` lines 33-41: Journal collection properly configured
  ```javascript
  allow read: if isOwner(userId);
  allow create, update: if false;  // BLOCKS direct client writes
  allow delete: if isOwner(userId); // GDPR compliance
  ```
- ✅ `firestore.rules` lines 47-55: Daily logs collection blocks direct writes
- ✅ `firestore.rules` lines 61-69: Inventory entries collection blocks direct writes
- ✅ Comments explicitly state: "SECURITY: All writes MUST go through Cloud Function"
- ✅ Comments explain: "Cloud Function enforces: rate limiting, Zod validation, App Check"
- ✅ Comments explain: "Direct client writes are BLOCKED to prevent bypassing security controls"

**Policy Decided**: Cloud Functions only (Option A - recommended approach)

**Alignment Verified**:
- Rules enforcement matches comments ✅
- Comments accurately describe security model ✅
- Cloud Functions are the canonical write surface ✅

**No Further Work Needed**: This CANON is complete and correct

**Dependencies**: ~~CANON-0002~~ (independent - rules work regardless of App Check status)

```

**Task Status**: ⚠️ **60% COMPLETE** (verified 2025-12-30)

**What's Aligned** (Primary Operations):
- ✅ Client `SAVE_DAILY_LOG`: 10 calls/60s → Server `saveDailyLog`: 10 req/60s (`functions/src/index.ts` lines 46-49)
- ✅ Client `SAVE_JOURNAL`: 10 calls/60s → Server `saveJournalEntry`: 10 req/60s (lines 134-137)
- ✅ Client `SAVE_INVENTORY`: 10 calls/60s → Server `saveInventoryEntry`: 10 req/60s (lines 337-340)
- ✅ Server uses `FirestoreRateLimiter` (persisted in Firestore, survives cold starts)
- ✅ Client uses `RateLimiter` class for UX feedback (non-security boundary)

**What's NOT Aligned** (Secondary Operations):
- ❌ Server `softDeleteJournalEntry`: 20 req/60s (lines 235-238) → NO client-side limit defined
- ❌ Server `migrateAnonymousUserData`: 5 req/300s (lines 445-448) → NO client-side limit defined
- ⚠️ Client-side limits can be bypassed (not a security issue since server enforces)

**Remaining Implementation Steps**:
1. **Add client-side rate limiters** for completeness (optional UX improvement):
   ```typescript
   // lib/constants.ts
   SOFT_DELETE_JOURNAL: { MAX_CALLS: 20, WINDOW_MS: 60000 }
   MIGRATE_USER_DATA: { MAX_CALLS: 5, WINDOW_MS: 300000 }
   ```
2. **Update hooks** to use new limiters for immediate UX feedback
3. **Document** that client limits are UX-only, server is security boundary

**Note**: Core security is intact (server enforces all limits). Missing client limits only affect UX (no immediate feedback).

**Dependencies**: ~~CANON-0001~~ (mostly complete - sufficient for rate limiting alignment)

**Task Status**: ❓ **UNKNOWN** - Needs Strategy Decision (verified 2025-12-30)

**Current State Observed**:
- ✅ Server-side uses Zod schemas (`functions/src/schemas.ts`)
  - `dailyLogSchema`, `journalEntrySchema`, `inventoryEntrySchema`, etc.
  - All schemas include optional `recaptchaToken: z.string().optional()`
- ⚠️ Client prepares data but doesn't validate before sending
- ⚠️ No unified client-side validation pattern observed in journal write paths
- ✅ Validation helpers exist: `lib/security/firestore-validation.ts`
  - `assertUserScope(userId)` - checks auth context
  - `validateUserDocumentPath(userId, path)` - checks path structure
- ❓ Unknown if these helpers are intentionally unused or forgotten

**Decision Needed**:
1. **Cloud Functions-only policy** (appears to be current approach):
   - ✅ Server validates everything with Zod
   - ❌ Client doesn't pre-validate (relies on server errors)
   - Strategy: Accept this as intentional (simpler client, validation at boundary)
   - Document: "Client validation unnecessary - server is security boundary"

2. **Client + Server validation** (defense in depth):
   - Add client-side Zod validation before calling Cloud Functions
   - Improves UX (immediate feedback before network call)
   - Adds complexity (duplicate validation logic)

**Recommendation**: Accept current state (Cloud Functions-only validation) and document it as intentional

**Remaining Steps**:
1. **Document validation strategy** in code comments or SECURITY.md
2. **Decision**: Is client-side pre-validation desired for UX?
3. **If yes**: Add Zod validation in hooks before calling Cloud Functions
4. **If no**: Document that validation happens server-side only
   - Ensure all client write paths call validation consistently

3. Add test coverage for validation behavior (mocked)

**Dependencies**: CANON-0001 must be complete first (write strategy decided)

}
```

**Task Status**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE** (verified 2025-12-30)

**What's Verified**:

**Journal Collection** (`firestore.rules` lines 30-41):
```javascript
// ============================================
// JOURNAL COLLECTION (Cloud Functions ONLY)
// Path: /users/{userId}/journal/{entryId}
// ============================================
match /users/{userId}/journal/{entryId} {
  allow read: if isOwner(userId);
  // SECURITY: All writes MUST go through Cloud Function (saveJournalEntry)
  // Cloud Function enforces: rate limiting, Zod validation, App Check
  // Direct client writes are BLOCKED to prevent bypassing security controls
  allow create, update: if false;
  // Keep delete for GDPR data deletion compliance
  allow delete: if isOwner(userId);
}
```

**Daily Logs Collection** (lines 43-55):
- ✅ Comments state "Cloud Functions ONLY"
- ✅ Enforcement: `allow create, update: if false;`
- ✅ Perfect alignment

**Inventory Entries Collection** (lines 57-69):
- ✅ Comments state "Cloud Functions ONLY"
- ✅ Enforcement: `allow create, update: if false;`
- ✅ Perfect alignment

**Legacy journalEntries Collection** (lines 72-80):
- ✅ Clearly marked as "Legacy"
- ✅ Allows client writes (intentional for backward compatibility)
- ✅ Comments match enforcement

**Alignment Verified**:
- ✅ Comments accurately describe enforcement
- ✅ No misleading statements
- ✅ Security model is clear and consistent
- ✅ Cloud Functions are documented as the only write path (except legacy collection)

**No Further Work Needed**: Comments and enforcement are perfectly aligned

**Dependencies**: ~~CANON-0043~~ (independent - comments are accurate regardless of validation strategy)

     - `functions/src/index.ts` - Made reCAPTCHA optional in migrateAnonymousUserData
   - **Commits**:
     - `16b5deb` - feat: Make reCAPTCHA optional for corporate network compatibility

#### ❌ PR1 Items NOT Completed (Verified 2025-12-30)

**CANON Completion Status** (based on codebase audit):

**⚠️ CANON-0001: Journal writes unified (95% complete - mostly done)**
- ✅ `hooks/use-journal.ts::addEntry` (line 212) → calls `saveJournalEntry` Cloud Function (line 247)
- ✅ `hooks/use-journal.ts::crumplePage` (line 290) → calls `softDeleteJournalEntry` Cloud Function (line 306)
- ✅ `lib/firestore-service.ts::saveDailyLog` (line 117) → calls Cloud Function (line 132)
- ✅ `lib/firestore-service.ts::saveInventoryEntry` (line 322) → calls Cloud Function (line 339)
- ✅ `lib/firestore-service.ts::saveNotebookJournalEntry` (line 396) → calls Cloud Function (line 412)
- ❌ `lib/firestore-service.ts::saveJournalEntry` (line 366-394) - DEPRECATED, direct Firestore write
- ❌ `components/notebook/journal-modal.tsx` (line 29) - uses deprecated `FirestoreService.saveJournalEntry`
- **BLOCKER**: One component still uses deprecated direct write method

**❌ CANON-0002: App Check enforcement (0% complete - OPPOSITE of goal)**
- ❌ `functions/src/index.ts` lines 78, 170, 265, 363: `requireAppCheck: false`
- ❌ `functions/src/index.ts` lines 492-497: App Check verification commented out
- ❌ `lib/firebase.ts` lines 45-78: App Check initialization entirely commented out
- **CRITICAL**: This is the OPPOSITE of PR1 goal

**✅ CANON-0003: Firestore rules alignment (100% complete)**
- ✅ `firestore.rules` lines 33-41: Journal collection blocks direct writes (`allow create, update: if false`)
- ✅ `firestore.rules` lines 47-55: Daily logs collection blocks direct writes
- ✅ `firestore.rules` lines 61-69: Inventory entries collection blocks direct writes
- ✅ Comments explicitly state "All writes MUST go through Cloud Function"
- **VERIFIED**: Rules correctly enforce Cloud Functions-only writes

**⚠️ CANON-0041: Rate limiting alignment (60% complete - partially done)**
- ✅ `lib/constants.ts` SAVE_DAILY_LOG: 10 calls/60s → matches server: 10 req/60s
- ✅ `lib/constants.ts` SAVE_JOURNAL: 10 calls/60s → matches server: 10 req/60s
- ✅ `lib/constants.ts` SAVE_INVENTORY: 10 calls/60s → matches server: 10 req/60s
- ❌ Server has softDeleteJournalEntry: 20 req/60s → NO client-side limit
- ❌ Server has migrateAnonymousUserData: 5 req/300s → NO client-side limit
- **GAP**: Primary operations aligned, but delete/migration lack client limits

**❓ CANON-0043: Client validation strategy (Unknown - needs investigation)**
- Server uses Zod schemas (`functions/src/schemas.ts`)
- Client prepares data but doesn't validate before sending
- No unified client-side validation pattern observed
- **NEEDS**: Verification if strategy was decided or documented

**✅ CANON-0044: Rules comment mismatch (100% complete)**
- ✅ `firestore.rules` lines 30-41: Journal - comprehensive security comments
- ✅ `firestore.rules` lines 43-55: Daily logs - detailed comments match enforcement
- ✅ `firestore.rules` lines 57-69: Inventory - clear security comments
- ✅ `firestore.rules` lines 72-80: Legacy journalEntries marked as "Legacy"
- **VERIFIED**: All comments are clear and match actual enforcement

#### ❌ Acceptance Tests NOT Run
- ❌ `npm run lint` - Not verified in session
- ❌ `npm run test` - Not verified in session
- ❌ Manual test: "create/update entry works; direct client write path removed" - Not done

## Reasoning & Decisions Made

### Why reCAPTCHA Was Implemented Instead of App Check

**Context**: The original PR1 goal was to **enable App Check**. Instead, work focused on **manual reCAPTCHA Enterprise** implementation.

**Decision Timeline** (from session summary):
1. **Initial Problem**: Firebase App Check experiencing 403 throttle errors
2. **First Solution Attempt**: Fixed API key typo, created new reCAPTCHA Enterprise key
3. **Implementation**: Added manual reCAPTCHA verification to frontend and backend
4. **New Problem Discovered**: Corporate networks (hospitals, treatment centers) block Google reCAPTCHA
   - Error: `ERR_CONNECTION_ABORTED` when loading reCAPTCHA script
   - Result: Users on corporate networks got 400 Bad Request errors
5. **Final Decision**: Make reCAPTCHA **optional** to support corporate networks
   - Logs `RECAPTCHA_MISSING_TOKEN` (WARNING) when token missing
   - Continues processing with other security layers (auth, rate limiting, validation)

### Why This Contradicts PR1 Goals

**PR1 Intended**: Strengthen security by enforcing App Check
**What Happened**: Weakened security by making reCAPTCHA optional

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Pro**: Users on corporate networks can now use the app
- ❌ **Con**: Bot protection degraded for 10-20% of users (those without reCAPTCHA)
- ❌ **Con**: Creates inconsistent security posture (some users protected, others not)
- ❌ **Con**: Defeats "defense in depth" strategy intended by PR1

### Why No Tests Were Added

**Reason**: Not documented in session summary. Likely due to:
- Focus shifted to reCAPTCHA implementation and debugging
- Corporate network issue consumed remaining time
- Tests were deprioritized in favor of fixing blocking issues

### Why Firestore Rules Weren't Updated

**Reason**: Not documented in session summary. Likely due to:
- reCAPTCHA work took longer than expected
- Rules review deferred to future work
- May have been blocked by uncertainty about write strategy

---

## Gap Analysis (Updated 2025-12-30)

### Intended vs. Actual Comparison

| Aspect | Intended (PR1 Goal) | Actual (What Happened) | Gap Severity |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **App Check** | Enable enforcement (`requireAppCheck: true`) | Disabled (`requireAppCheck: false`) everywhere | 🔴 CRITICAL - Opposite |
| **Write Surface** | Single Cloud Function callable | 95% complete - one deprecated method remains | 🟡 MEDIUM - Mostly done |
| **Firestore Rules** | Review and align with policy | ✅ COMPLETE - rules block direct writes | 🟢 COMPLETE |
| **Rate Limiting** | Server enforcement, client UX-only | 60% complete - main ops aligned, delete/migration missing client limits | 🟡 MEDIUM - Partial |
| **Validation** | Consistent client strategy or CF-only | Unknown - needs investigation | 🟡 HIGH - Unverified |
| **Tests** | Add coverage for write paths | Not done | 🟡 HIGH |
| **Documentation** | Security policy documentation | Partial - monitoring docs added | 🟢 LOW |

### Completion Metrics (Verified via Codebase Audit)

- **CANON Items Complete**: 2/6 (33%)
  - ✅ CANON-0003: Firestore rules alignment (100%)
  - ✅ CANON-0044: Rules comment mismatch (100%)
  - ⚠️ CANON-0001: Journal writes unified (95% - blocker: 1 deprecated method in use)
  - ⚠️ CANON-0041: Rate limiting alignment (60% - main ops aligned)
  - ❌ CANON-0002: App Check enforcement (0% - OPPOSITE of goal)
  - ❓ CANON-0043: Client validation strategy (Unknown)
- **Critical (S0) Items Complete**: 0/2 (0%)
  - ❌ CANON-0001: 95% done but not 100%
  - ❌ CANON-0002: 0% - disabled instead of enabled
- **High (S1) Items Complete**: 2/4 (50%)
  - ✅ CANON-0003: 100% - rules aligned
  - ✅ CANON-0044: 100% - comments fixed
  - ⚠️ CANON-0041: 60% - partial alignment
  - ❓ CANON-0043: Unknown - needs investigation
- **Acceptance Tests Passed**: 0/3 (0%)
- **Overall Phase 1 Completion**: **33%** (2 of 6 CANON items fully complete)

### Root Cause Analysis

**Why did PR1 diverge from plan?**

1. **Blocking Issue Discovered**: Firebase App Check 403 throttle errors blocked progress
2. **Solution Shifted Scope**: Manual reCAPTCHA implementation was not in original PR1 scope
3. **New Issue Emerged**: Corporate network blocking required making reCAPTCHA optional
4. **Time Consumed**: Debugging and implementing workarounds consumed all available time
5. **Original Goals Lost**: PR1 original goals (canonical write surface, rules review, etc.) were never started

**Pattern**: Reactive firefighting vs. planned refactoring

---

## Plan to Complete Remaining Work

### Prerequisites (Must Do First)

1. **Decide on App Check Strategy**:
   - **Option A**: Re-enable App Check alongside optional reCAPTCHA (defense in depth)
   - **Option B**: Use only optional reCAPTCHA (simpler but weaker)
   - **Option C**: Wait for Firebase App Check throttle to clear, then re-enable
   - **Recommendation**: Option A - both layers provide different protections

2. **Verify Current Write Surface**:
   - Audit `hooks/use-journal.ts::addEntry` - does it write directly or call Cloud Function?
   - Audit `lib/firestore-service.ts::saveNotebookJournalEntry` - is it used or obsolete?
   - Audit `functions/src/index.ts` - does `saveNotebookEntryCallable` exist?
   - **Output**: Document current state before making changes

### Step-by-Step Completion Plan

#### Step 1: Complete CANON-0001 (Canonical Write Surface)

**Time Estimate**: 4-6 hours

1. **Audit current state**:
   ```bash
   # Find all journal write locations
   grep -r "addDoc\|setDoc\|updateDoc" hooks/use-journal.ts lib/firestore-service.ts
   grep -r "journal\|notebook" functions/src/index.ts
   ```

2. **Ensure Cloud Function exists**:
   - Read `functions/src/index.ts`
   - Verify `saveNotebookEntryCallable` or similar exists
   - If missing, create it with:
     - Input validation (Zod schema)
     - Auth check (must be authenticated)
     - Rate limiting (server-side)
     - App Check enforcement (if re-enabled)
     - Data write to Firestore
     - Return success/error

3. **Create client wrapper**:
   - File: `lib/functions/notebook.ts`
   - Export: `async function saveNotebookEntry(data: NotebookEntry): Promise<void>`
   - Implementation: Call Cloud Function via `httpsCallable`
   - Error handling: Normalize Firebase errors for UI

4. **Migrate hook**:
   - Update `hooks/use-journal.ts::addEntry` to call `saveNotebookEntry` wrapper
   - Remove direct Firestore SDK imports (`addDoc`, `setDoc`, etc.)
   - Update error handling to work with callable errors

5. **Handle service layer**:
   - If `lib/firestore-service.ts::saveNotebookJournalEntry` is used elsewhere:
     - Make it delegate to wrapper
   - If unused:
     - Delete it
     - Verify no imports remain (grep check)

6. **Test**:
   - Manual: Create/update journal entry works
   - Unit test: Mock callable, verify hook calls it correctly
   - Grep verification: No direct Firestore writes remain

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ All journal writes route through Cloud Function
- ✅ Direct Firestore SDK writes removed from client code
- ✅ Tests pass
- ✅ Manual testing confirms functionality

---

#### Step 2: Complete CANON-0002 (Enable App Check)

**Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours

**Prerequisite**: Decide on App Check strategy (see above)

**If enabling App Check**:

1. **Update Cloud Function**:
   ```typescript
   // functions/src/index.ts
   export const saveNotebookEntry = onCall<NotebookEntryData>(
     {
       enforceAppCheck: true,
       consumeAppCheckToken: true,
     },
     async (request) => {
       // ... existing implementation
     }
   );
   ```

2. **Keep reCAPTCHA as optional layer**:
   - App Check provides bot protection
   - reCAPTCHA provides additional verification when available
   - Both layers are complementary (defense in depth)

3. **Set up debug tokens**:
   - Generate debug token in Firebase Console
   - Add to `.env.local`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPCHECK_DEBUG_TOKEN=xxx`
   - Update `lib/firebase.ts` to use debug token in development

4. **Test**:
   - Development: Verify debug token works
   - Production: Verify App Check token generated and accepted
   - Logs: Check for App Check errors

**If NOT enabling App Check**:
- Document reasoning in this section
- Update PR1 goal to reflect reality
- Consider impact on security posture

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ App Check enforcement matches documented policy
- ✅ Debug tokens work in development
- ✅ Production App Check works (or decision documented to not use it)
- ✅ Tests pass

---

#### Step 3: Complete CANON-0041 (Rate Limiting Alignment)

**Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours

1. **Implement server-side rate limiting**:
   - Use existing security-wrapper.ts pattern (already has rate limiting)
   - Ensure journal callable uses rate limiter
   - Verify limits are reasonable (e.g., 10 writes/minute per user)

2. **Keep client limiter as UX-only**:
   - Client shows immediate feedback ("Please wait before submitting again")
   - Server enforces actual limit (security boundary)

3. **Add tests**:
   - Unit test: Callable rejects rapid submits
   - Integration test: Client receives correct error message

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Server enforces rate limits
- ✅ Client provides UX feedback
- ✅ Tests cover rate limiting behavior
- ✅ Manual test: Rapid submits are throttled

---

#### Step 4: Complete CANON-0003 (Verify Rule Alignment)

**Time Estimate**: 30 minutes

1. **Read Firestore rules for journal collection**
2. **Compare comment vs. enforcement**
3. **Decide canonical policy**:
   - If Cloud Functions-only: `allow write: if false;`
   - If client writes allowed: Document why and update rules accordingly
4. **Update comments to match reality**
5. **Deploy rules**: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Comments match actual enforcement
- ✅ Policy decision documented
- ✅ Rules deployed

---

#### Step 5: Complete CANON-0043 (Client Validation Strategy)

**Time Estimate**: 3-4 hours

**If Cloud Functions-only** (recommended):
- Client validation helpers not needed for journal writes
- Server handles all validation
- Document this decision

**If client writes allowed**:
- Audit `hooks/use-journal.ts::addEntry` for validation calls
- Add `assertUserScope` and `validateUserDocumentPath` consistently
- Test validation behavior

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Validation strategy documented
- ✅ Implementation matches strategy
- ✅ Tests pass

---

#### Step 6: Complete CANON-0044 (Fix Rules Comment Mismatch)

**Time Estimate**: 30 minutes

1. **Read current rules and comments**
2. **Update comments to match enforcement** (from CANON-0003 work)
3. **Deploy updated rules**

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ No comment/enforcement mismatch
- ✅ Rules deployed

---

### Total Estimated Time to Complete Phase 1

**Optimistic**: 12 hours (if write surface already correct, App Check straightforward)
**Realistic**: 17 hours (if significant refactoring needed)
**Pessimistic**: 24 hours (if major issues discovered)

---

## Notes for Future Sessions

### Before Starting Phase 1 Work

1. **Read this entire Phase 1 section** (do not skip gap analysis)
2. **Decide App Check strategy** before writing code
3. **Verify current state** of write surfaces before making changes
4. **Follow dependency order** (CANON-0001 first, then others)
5. **Update this document** as you complete each CANON item

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't disable App Check** without documenting reasoning
2. **Don't create new write surfaces** - consolidate to one
3. **Don't skip tests** - they protect against regressions
4. **Don't forget to update Firestore rules** after code changes
5. **Don't implement features outside PR1 scope** (resist scope creep)

### Questions to Answer Before Proceeding

- [ ] What is the current state of journal write surfaces? (needs audit)
- [ ] Should App Check be re-enabled or remain disabled? (decision needed)
- [ ] Should journal writes be Cloud Functions-only or allow client writes? (decision needed)
- [ ] What is the target rate limit for journal writes? (needs specification)

## Intentions & Goals

### Primary Goal
Consolidate Firestore access and journal typing while removing duplicated client writes and admin init boilerplate.

### Specific Objectives
1. **Pick canonical Firestore service**: Choose one abstraction layer and migrate all code to use it
2. **Unify journal types**: Consolidate multiple JournalEntry type definitions into single canonical module
3. **Atomic gratitude writes**: Use batch/transaction for multi-document operations
4. **Centralize admin SDK init**: Extract boilerplate from scripts into shared module
5. **Route slogan widget through service**: Remove direct Firestore access from components
6. **Consolidate collection paths**: Use constants/helpers instead of string literals

### Why This Phase Matters
Inconsistent Firestore access patterns create maintenance nightmares:
- Each write surface has different validation, error handling, and mapping logic
- Type drift between different JournalEntry definitions causes runtime bugs
- Direct SDK usage in components bypasses security checks
- Gratitude writes can create partial state (inventory without journal)
- Admin scripts duplicate initialization code

Phase 2 establishes canonical patterns that all subsequent phases build upon.

## Appendix D: Between-PR Checklist

After completing each phase, follow this checklist before starting the next:

### 1. Rebase + Sanity Build
```bash
git pull origin main
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build  # Critical for Next.js

Search for old patterns to ensure they're gone:
```bash
# Example: Verify old paths removed
grep -r "users/\${" .
grep -r "journalEntries" .
grep -r "onAuthStateChanged" hooks/
```

### 4. Update This Document
- Mark CANON items as ✅ DONE
- Fill in "What Was Accomplished"
- Update gap analysis
- Increment completion percentage
