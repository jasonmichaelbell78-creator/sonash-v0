# SoNash Expansion: Module 2 – Sponsor Tooling & Connection

**Core Philosophy:** "The Bridge."
The app is a private sanctuary, but recovery requires connection. These tools bridge the gap between digital isolation and human accountability without creating a "surveillance state."

---

## Category 1: Sponsee Enacted (The Push)

*Tools the user initiates to share data, ask for help, or manage the relationship.*

### 1. Sponsor Export & "Redaction Pre-Flight"

*Merged: "Sponsor Export (PDF)" + "Redaction Pre-Flight Check"*

* **Expanded Description:** Sharing a journal is terrifying. This tool acts as a "security clearance" for the user's own thoughts. It generates a clean, printable PDF of specific worksheets or journals but gives the user absolute control *before* the file is generated.
* **The Workflow:**
  1. **Select Scope:** User chooses a specific Step (e.g., "Step 4") or date range.
  2. **Scan:** The app presents a scrollable, document-style preview of exactly what will be shared.
  3. **Redact:** User swipes across sensitive paragraphs to visually "black them out" or taps "Exclude" to remove sections entirely.
  4. **Annotate:** User adds a "Cover Note" (e.g., "I'm ready to talk about the blacked-out parts in person, just not in writing").
  5. **Send:** Generates the sanitized PDF to share via system native sheet (Signal, iMessage, etc.).

### 2. The "Hard Conversation" Script Library & Drafts

*Merged: "Ask Sponsor Draft" + "Script Library"*

* **Expanded Description:** When a sponsee is in trouble (relapse, resentment, fear), shame often causes silence. This tool lowers the friction of reaching out by providing pre-written, non-shaming templates for high-stakes moments.
* **The Tool:** A "Compose" screen with a "Template" button.
* **Template Examples:**
  * *The "I Slipped" Text:* "I need to be honest. I drank/used. I'm safe, but I need to talk when you're free."
  * *The "I'm Stuck" Text:* "I'm spinning my wheels on Step 4. Can we schedule 15 mins to unblock me?"
  * *The "Resentment" Text:* "I'm angry at you right now and I don't want to be. Can we talk about it?"
* **Action:** Tapping a template copies it to the system clipboard or opens the user's preferred messaging app, keeping the actual chat outside of SoNash for privacy.

### 3. "Mood-Stamped" Check-In & Quick Dial

*Merged: "Sponsee Help Request" + "Mood-Stamped Check-In"*

* **Expanded Description:** A text saying "I'm fine" is often a lie. This tool allows the user to communicate their emotional state instantly using visual data rather than paragraphs, paired with immediate access to support.
* **The Tool:** A "Check-In" generator.
* **The Workflow:**
  1. **Input:** User taps their current **HALT** status (Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired) and a **Willingness** slider (1–10).
  2. **Generate:** The app creates a small, clean image card (visualizing the data like a Spotify Share card).
  3. **Action:** The user can "Send Image" to their sponsor or tap the **"Quick Dial" FAB** (Floating Action Button) to call them immediately if the stats are in the danger zone.

### 4. Next Call Agenda ("The Parking Lot")

*Merged: "Next Call Agenda Builder" + "The Parking Lot"*

* **Expanded Description:** Sponsees often forget the critical issues they faced midweek by the time their scheduled sponsor call happens. This is a global "quick capture" system to ensure nothing important is lost.
* **The Tool:** A "Park for Sponsor" button available on every worksheet and journal entry.
* **The Workflow:**
  * *During the Week:* If a user hits a block or has a breakthrough, they tap "Park for Sponsor."
  * *During the Call:* The user opens the **"Agenda Mode."** All parked items are presented as a checklist (e.g., "Discuss fear from Tuesday," "Clarify Step 6 definition").
  * *After the Call:* User checks them off as "Discussed."

### 5. "Circle of Trust" & Invite Manager

*Merged: "Sponsor Invite Link" + "Circle of Trust"*

* **Expanded Description:** Recovery often involves more than one support person (Service Sponsor, Step Sponsor, Therapist). This permissions manager reflects that reality.
* **The Tool:** A contact management screen where the user assigns roles.
* **The Roles:**
  * *Primary Sponsor:* Access to shared Step Work & Safety Plans.
  * *Accountability Partner:* Access to Meeting Attendance & Daily Check-in stats only.
  * *Therapist:* Access to Mood Logs & specific journals only.
* **Action:** Generates unique, role-specific invite links that grant these specific read-only permissions (if the cloud sync feature is active) or sets defaults for manual exports.

### 6. The Sponsor Vetting Guide

*New Feature*

* **Expanded Description:** Newcomers often pick the wrong sponsor (predatory, unavailable, or incompatible) out of desperation. This private decision matrix helps them pause and evaluate safety.
* **The Tool:** A private checklist the user fills out *about* a potential sponsor.
* **The Checklist:**
  * *Do they have what I want?*
  * *Do they speak the language of recovery?*
  * *Do they respect boundaries?*
  * *Did they mention the Steps (or just their own opinions)?*
* **Outcome:**
  * *Mostly "Yes":* Offers the **"Script to Ask"** template.
  * *Mostly "No":* Displays a warning: "Take your time. You don't have to decide today."

## Category 2: Sponsor Enacted (The Pull/Collaborative)

*Tools designed to help the sponsor understand data, collaborate, or provide accountability. (Note: These are "Sponsor-Facing" but often generated/facilitated by the User's app).*

### 1. Sponsor Summary & "The Cheat Sheet"

*Merged: "Sponsor Summary Report" + "Sponsor's Cheat Sheet"*

* **Expanded Description:** Sponsors are often busy and don't know how to interpret raw app data. This feature turns a "Data Dump" into a "Training Manual" for the sponsor.
* **The Tool:** A one-page aggregate report with an educational footer.
* **The Report:** High-level stats (Days Sober, Meetings This Week, Mood Trend line) without private details.
* **The Cheat Sheet (Footer):** A static guide appended to the export:
  * *"How to read this: Look for patterns in the 'Time of Day' column on the mood log."*
  * *"Red Flags: If 'Resentment' counts are up, ask about their prayer/meditation routine."*
  * *"Safety Note: This user has flagged 'Trauma' on page 4—approach with care."*

### 2. The "Relapse Autopsy" Worksheet (Collaborative)

*New Feature*

* **Expanded Description:** After a relapse, the sponsor/sponsee relationship is often strained or chaotic. This tool provides a structured, neutral ground for debriefing, designed to be filled out *during* a call.
* **The Tool:** A specific worksheet locked until a "Reset" event occurs.
* **The Questions (Collaborative):**
  * *The Setup:* "What happened 24 hours *before* the event?" (e.g., skipped meal, argument).
  * *The Trigger:* "What was the exact moment the mental decision was made?"
  * *The Barrier:* "Why didn't I pick up the phone?" (Identifies the failure point).
  * *The Plan:* "What is ONE thing we change for next time?"
* **Output:** Generates a **"Safety Plan V2"** image card that saves to the user's home screen.

### 3. Shared Commitments ("The Digital Handshake")

*Merged: "Shared Commitments Board" + "Co-Sponsor Handshake"*

* **Expanded Description:** A mechanism for accountability that relies on integrity rather than gamified streaks. It digitally mimics looking someone in the eye and saying, "I did it."
* **The Tool:** A 2-way toggle board (requires linked accounts or manual "Witness" entry).
* **The Workflow:**
  1. **Agreement:** Sponsor and Sponsee agree on a goal (e.g., "90 meetings in 90 days" or "Call daily").
  2. **The Log:** Sponsee taps "Did it."
  3. **The Witness:** The Sponsor sees the update and taps "Witnessed" (a checkmark or 'fist bump' icon).
  4. **Offline Fallback:** If not digitally linked, the user manually checks a box: *"I reported this to [Sponsor Name] at [Time]."*

### 4. Sponsor Prompt Library

*Expansion of "Sponsor Prompt Library"*

* **Expanded Description:** Sometimes sponsors want to reach out but don't want to be overbearing. This resource provides them with gentle, effective questions to send to the user.
* **The Tool:** A web-viewable or exportable list of prompts the user can send to their sponsor: *"Here is a list of questions I respond well to."*
* **The Prompts:**
  * *"What is the loudest thought in your head right now?"*
  * *"Have you eaten something nutritious today?"*
  * *"Where did you see your Higher Power today?"*
  * *"Are you holding onto anything you need to let go of?"*

### 5. One-Time Share Code

*Expansion of "One-Time Share Code"*

* **Expanded Description:** A security feature for sponsors who do not have the app. It allows them to view a specific document securely without receiving a permanent file that could be leaked.
* **The Tool:** A link generator.
* **The Action:** User selects a document (e.g., "Step 4 - Fears"). App generates a URL.
* **The Security:**
  * **Time-Limited:** The link expires automatically in 24 hours.
  * **Read-Only:** The document cannot be edited.
  * **Revocable:** The user can tap "Kill Link" at any time to immediately revoke access.
