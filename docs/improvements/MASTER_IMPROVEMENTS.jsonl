Consider replacing with a SHA-256 hash prefix or anonymized operator ID for privacy compliance while maintaining audit traceability.","impact":"I3","effort":"E1","confidence":75,"status":"PROPOSED","fingerprint":"devx-automation::scripts/improvements/intake-audit.js::operator-pii-audit-logs","file":"scripts/improvements/intake-audit.js","line":779,"created":"2026-02-11","current_approach":"Raw os.userInfo().username or $USER/$USERNAME stored in intake audit log entries","proposed_outcome":"SHA-256 hash prefix of username (e.g., first 8 chars) provides audit traceability without exposing PII","counter_argument":"This is an internal CLI script run by developers — the operator field provides accountability and the logs are local, not shared externally. Hashing adds complexity for minimal privacy benefit in a single-user context.","why_it_matters":"If audit logs are ever committed, shared, or retained in CI, raw usernames become PII that may violate data handling policies. A hash-based approach maintains auditability without exposure risk."}

Git commit history already tracks who ran what and when.","why_it_matters":"For audit trail completeness, knowing who triggered the pipeline and the high-level outcome makes log reconstruction easier without needing to correlate with git history."}
