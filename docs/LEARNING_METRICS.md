**Last Updated:** 2026-03-01

---

## Purpose

This document tracks Claude's learning effectiveness - whether documented
patterns prevent recurring issues. It provides actionable metrics to guide
automation priorities and documentation improvements.

**Auto-generated by:** `scripts/analyze-learning-effectiveness.js` **Update
frequency:** After consolidation (every 10 reviews) or manual analysis

---

## AI Instructions

This is a **Tier 2 metrics document** - reference during:

- **Post-consolidation**: Check if patterns are being learned
- **Session planning**: Prioritize automation for failing patterns
- **Pattern updates**: Validate that documentation improvements work

### Key Metrics

| Metric                    | Value |
| ------------------------- | ----- |
| Learning Effectiveness    | 95.0% |
| Patterns Learned          | 322   |
| Patterns Automated        | 23    |
| Patterns Failing          | 2     |
| Critical Pattern Success  | 97.9% |
| Automation Coverage       | 14.0% |

| Total Automated Patterns  | 51    |

### Top Recommended Actions

1. **[Automation]** Automate "Pre\-commit ADM filter"
   - Recurred 3 times after documentation \(Reviews: 404, 407, 416\)
   - Action: Add pattern to check\-pattern\-compliance.js

2. **[Automation]** Automate "AI reviewer verification"
   - Recurred 3 times after documentation \(Reviews: 403, 408, 416\)
   - Action: Add pattern to check\-pattern\-compliance.js

3. **[Documentation]** Improve documentation for "Binary file detection"
   - Recurred 2 times \- documentation may be unclear
   - Action: Review and enhance pattern documentation in CODE_PATTERNS.md

4. **[Documentation]** Improve documentation for "Atomic file writes"
   - Recurred 2 times \- documentation may be unclear
   - Action: Review and enhance pattern documentation in CODE_PATTERNS.md

5. **[Training]** Create guide for "Symlink write guard"
   - Critical pattern with 3 recurrences needs dedicated guide
   - Action: Create docs/agent_docs/SYMLINK_WRITE_GUARD_GUIDE.md

## Pattern Learning Status Summary

| Status       | Count | Description                                  |
| ------------ | ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ LEARNED   | 322   | Pattern never recurred after documentation   |
| 🔧 AUTOMATED | 23    | Pattern recurred but now enforced by tooling |
| 🟡 WEAK      | 16    | Pattern recurred 1-2 times - needs attention |
| 🔴 FAILED    | 2     | Pattern recurred 3+ times - needs automation |
