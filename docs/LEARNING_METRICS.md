**Last Updated:** 2026-01-24

---

## Quick Start

1. **Check effectiveness**: Review Key Metrics table for current learning rate
2. **Find failing patterns**: Look at Pattern Learning Status Summary for 🔴
   FAILED items
3. **Regenerate**: Run `node scripts/analyze-learning-effectiveness.js`

---

## Purpose

This document tracks Claude's learning effectiveness - whether documented
patterns prevent recurring issues. It provides actionable metrics to guide
automation priorities and documentation improvements.

**Auto-generated by:** `scripts/analyze-learning-effectiveness.js` **Update
frequency:** After consolidation (every 10 reviews) or manual analysis

---

## AI Instructions

This is a **Tier 2 metrics document** - reference during:

- **Post-consolidation**: Check if patterns are being learned
- **Session planning**: Prioritize automation for failing patterns
- **Pattern updates**: Validate that documentation improvements work

## Pattern Learning Status Summary

| Status       | Count | Description                                  |
| ------------ | ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
