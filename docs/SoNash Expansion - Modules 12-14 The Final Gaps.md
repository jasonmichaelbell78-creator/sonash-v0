# SoNash Expansion: Modules 12, 13, 14 (The Final Gaps)

**Overview:** These modules address the "Whole Person" (Finances, Body) and the
"Long Tail" of recovery (Old Timers), ensuring the app remains valuable from Day
0 to Year 10.

---

## Module 12: Financial Repair ("The Sobriety Dividend")

### 1. "The Savings Ticker" (The Anti-Cost)

- **The Concept:** Users underestimate how much money they blew on their
  addiction. Seeing that money _accumulate_ instead is a dopamine hit.
- **The Tool:** A cumulative calculator.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Input:** "I used to spend [$X] per [Day/Week]."
  - **The Ticker:** A live counter on the dashboard: _"You have saved $1,240
    since getting sober."_
  - **The Purchase:** It translates that cash into rewards: _"That's equal to: 1
    Month of Rent" or "A new Guitar."_

### 2. "The Wreckage List" (Debt Inventory)

- **The Concept:** Part of Step 9 (Amends) is often financial restitution.
  Avoiding creditors creates anxiety.
- **The Tool:** A debt snowball tracker (Safe/Private).
- **Feature:**
  - **The List:** User lists debts (Court Fines, Child Support, Personal Loans)
    without linking bank accounts (manual entry for privacy).
  - **The Plan:** User sets a tiny monthly goal (e.g., "$10/month").
  - **The Visual:** A progress bar for "Clearing the Wreckage."
  - **Why:** It turns a terrifying mountain of debt into a manageable game.

### 3. "The Envelope" (Budgeting for Beginners)

- **The Concept:** Newly sober people often don't know how to budget. Complex
  apps (Mint/YNAB) are overwhelming.
- **The Tool:** A "Cash Envelope" simulator.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Buckets:** "Rent," "Food," "Cigarettes/Vapes," "Recovery."
  - **The Logic:** Simple subtraction. _"You have $20 left for food this week."_
  - **Nashville Integration:** Links to local resources for financial aid or
    food banks if the "Food" bucket hits $0.

## Module 13: Bio-Rhythm & Wearables ("The Body Truth")

### 4. "The Stress Monitor" (Heart Rate Alerts)

- **The Concept:** High heart rate (HR) is a physical predictor of
  craving/agitation.
- **The Tool:** Integration with Apple Health / Google Fit.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Trigger:** If resting heart rate spikes (and user isn't moving), the
    app sends a silent notification.
  - **The Prompt:** _"Your heart is racing. Check in?"_
  - **The Action:** Deep-links to the **"Pause Protocol"** (Module 9) to breathe
    it down.

### 5. "Sleep Truth" (Recovery's Foundation)

- **The Concept:** Poor sleep is the #1 precursor to relapse. Users will claim
  they are "fine" while sleeping 3 hours a night.
- **The Tool:** Automated sleep correlation.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Data:** Pulls sleep duration from the phone/watch.
  - **The Insight:** _"You've slept <5 hours for 3 days. Your risk of
    irritability is high today."_
  - **The Nudge:** Suggests an earlier wind-down routine from Module 9.

### 6. "Movement as Medicine" (Step & Activity Tracker)

- **The Concept:** Depression keeps people on the couch. Motion changes emotion.
- **The Tool:** A non-fitness-obsessed activity log.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Goal:** "Move your body for 15 minutes." (Not "Burn 500 calories").
  - **The Nashville Twist:** _"Walk the Shelby Bottoms Greenway"_ or _"Walk
    around Centennial Park"_ suggestions.

## Module 14: The "Old Timer" Toolkit ("The Elder Mode")

### 7. "The Sponsee CRM" (Mentor Dashboard)

- **The Concept:** Sponsors manage multiple sponsees in their head. They forget
  anniversaries or who is on Step 4.
- **The Tool:** A private "Caseload" manager.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Profile:** "John D." (Clean Date: Jan 12). (Current Step: 4).
  - **The Notes:** _"Struggling with mom," "Call on Tuesdays."_
  - **The Reminder:** _"John's 1 year anniversary is next week. Send a text."_

### 8. "The Speaker's Outline" (Story Builder)

- **The Concept:** Old timers are asked to "share their story" at meetings. They
  often ramble or forget key points.
- **The Tool:** A story structuring tool.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Template:** "What it was like," "What happened," "What it's like now."
  - **The Timeline:** Pulls from their **"Scroll of Life"** (Module 11) to
    remind them of key turning points.
  - **The Output:** A simple cue-card view for holding while speaking at a
    podium.

### 9. "The Legacy Archive" (Wisdom Capture)

- **The Concept:** Long-term recovery generates wisdom. It shouldn't be lost.
- **The Tool:** A searchable database of their own insights.
- **Feature:**
  - **The Search:** User can search their 5 years of journals for "Grief" or
    "Job Loss" to see how they handled it last time.
  - **The Use Case:** When a sponsee asks about a problem, the sponsor can look
    up their own experience: _"Here is what I wrote when I went through that in
    2024."_

---

## The Missing Glue: "Day 0" Onboarding

### 10. "The Intake Interview" (Chat-Based Setup)

- **The Concept:** Don't use a settings menu. Use a conversation.
- **The Tool:** A conversational wizard.
- **The Flow:**
  - _App:_ "Hey. Welcome to SoNash. Tough day or good day?"
  - _User:_ "Tough."
  - _App:_ "Got it. Let's keep this simple. Do you want to find a meeting, or
    just vent?"
  - _User:_ "Vent."
  - _App:_ Opens the **Journal** immediately. No account creation, no setup.
    Just value.

### 11. "The Slow Rollout" (Progressive Disclosure)

- **The Concept:** Hide 80% of the app on Day 1.
- **The Feature:**
  - **Day 1:** Only Journal, Meeting Finder, and Panic Button are visible.
  - **Day 3:** Unlock "Check-Ins."
  - **Day 7:** Unlock "Step Work."
  - **Day 30:** Unlock "Service Tools."
- **Why:** Prevents cognitive overload.
